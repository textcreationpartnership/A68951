            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For your exceeding Clemency, mildeneſſe, and rare modeſtie, in the moſt eminent eſtate of ſo mighty a Monarche; as it cannot but winne vnto your great loue, in the hartes of all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Subjects: ſo on the other ſide doth it encourage them confidently to open their mindes, and in dutifull manner to vnfolde themſelues vnto their ſo louing and affable a Soueraigne.

<pb facs="tcp:21661:3"/> a worke?

Finally, for a proofe of my ſincerity, affection, and dutifull loue towardes your Majeſtie, this may I juſtly ſay, that in time of vncertaine fortune (when aſſured friends are moſt certainely tried) I both ſuffered diſgrace, &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance for it, being ſtiled in Print, <hi>A Scotiſt in faction:</hi> therein farther employing my penne in <hi>A two-folde diſcourſe</hi> (which I hope hath beene preſented to the viewe of your Majeſtie) the one conteyning a defence of your Highnes honour: the other of your title, and intereſt of the Crowne of England. And if then my zeale and loue of truth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to your Majeſty, drewe me out of the compaſſe of mine owne profeſsion, to treate of lawe courſes: I truſt your benigne Grace will now licence me, out of the ſame fountaine of feruencie and like zeale vnto Gods truth, no leſſe reſpecting your Majeſties eternall honour, and heauenly inheritance, ſomething to ſay in matters of diuinity: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene the beſt part of my ſtudie, for more then thriſe ſeauen yeares.</p>
                  <p>Whereinto I may conueniently enter with that golden ſentence, with which your Majeſtie beganne the Conference, holden in Ianuary laſt, betweene certaine of your ſubjects, about ſome controuerſie in Religion: <hi>A loue principium:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. cap. 1.8.</note> or conformable to that in holy writte, <hi>I am Alpha, and Omega,</hi> that is, <hi>The beginning, and the end,</hi> ſaith our Lord: And applying it vnto Princes, I may be bolde to ſay, that nothing is more expedient, and neceſſary for Kinges: nothing more honourable, and of better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance for their eſtate, then that in the very beginning of their raigne, they take eſpeciall order, that the ſupreame, and moſt puiſſant Monarch of heauen and earth, be purely, and vprightly ſerued, aſwell in their owne exemplare liues, as throughout their Dominions. For of Almighty God his meere bountie and great grace, they receiue and holde their Diadems and Princelie Scepters: and cannot poſſeſſe and enjoy them (their mighty Forces, and moſt prudent Counſailes notwithſtanding) one day longer, then during his diuine will and pleaſure. Which that wiſe King witneſſeth,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 4</note> ſpeaking in the perſon of Gods wiſedome, <hi>Per me Reges reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> By me Kinges doe raigne. And <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> ſometime King of Babilon,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.</note> was turned out to graſe with beaſtes, for ſeauen yeares, and made to knowe and confeſſe, that the higheſt doth commaund ouer the Kingdomes of men, and diſpoſeth of them, as pleaſeth his diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But I neede not ſtande vpon this point, being ſo well knowne, and duely confeſſed by your Majeſtie.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21661:3"/>
                  <p>But ſithens there be in this our moſt miſerable age, great diuerſities of Religions, and but one only, wherewith God is truely ſerued and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>One body, one Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>as you are called into one hope of your vocation, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme:</hi> My moſt humble ſuite and ſupplication, to your high Majeſtie is, that you to your eternall good, will embrace, maintayne, and ſet forth that only true, Catholike, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike faith, wherein all your moſt royall progenitors liued and died: or if you cannot be wonne ſo ſoone, to alter that Religion in which it hath beene your misfortune, to haue beene bredde and brought vp: That then in the meane ſeaſon, you will not ſo heauely perſecute, the ſincere profeſſors of the other.</p>
                  <p>Very many vrgent, and forcible reaſons might be produced, in fauour and defence of the Catholike Roman Religion, whereof diuers haue bin in moſt learned treatiſes, tendered to your Majeſtie already. Wherefore I will only touch three: two of them choſen out of the ſubject of this booke: The third ſelected from a ſentence of your Majeſties, recorded in the aforeſaid Conference.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe that argument is, as moſt ſenſible, ſo beſt aſſured, which proceedeth from a principle that is either euident in it ſelfe, or elſe graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and confeſſed for true: My firſt proofe ſhall be grounded vpon that your Majeſties owne reſolute, and conſtant opinion (as it appeareth in the ſaid conference) to witte:<note place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> 
                     <hi>That no Church ought farther to ſeperate it ſelfe from the Church of Rome, either in doctrine or ceremonie, then ſhee hath departed from her ſelfe, when ſhee was in her flouriſhing, and beſt eſtate.</hi> From whence I deduce this reaſon: The principall Pillers of the Church of Rome in her moſt flouriſhing eſtate, taught in all pointes of Religion, the ſame Doctrine, that ſhee now holdeth and teacheth; and in expreſſe tearmes condemneth for errour and hereſie, moſt of thoſe Articles, which the Proteſtants e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme to be the principall parts of their reformed Goſpell: Therefore if your Majeſtie will reſolutelie embrace, and conſtantly defend that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the Roman Church maintayned in her moſt flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; you muſt forſake the Proteſtant, and take the Catholike into your Princely protection.</p>
                  <p>To demonſtrate vnto your Majeſtie, that we now holde in all points, the very ſame Doctrine, which the moſt approued auncient Doctors, and holy Fathers held and deliuered: Becauſe it is to long for an Epiſtle, I reſerue it to the booke it ſelfe, for the points it handleth; and will here briefly note out of it, ſome ſuch old reproued errors, that the Proteſtants doe reuiue, receiue, and avowe, as the very ſinnewes of their Goſpell. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> the ring-leader of the newe pretended reformation, layeth for the ground-worke of his Religion, <hi>That man is iuſtified by only faith:</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:21661:4"/> in this he is applauded and followed of all Proteſtants: and yet as teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the moſt ſound witnes of antiquity,<note place="margin">Au de ſide &amp; operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ca. 14.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>only faith is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to Saluation,</hi> was an error ſprong vp in the Apoſtles dayes; againſt which, the Catholike Epiſtles of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iames,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> were principally directed. And the authour of that error was that infamous Sorcerer <hi>Simon Magus;</hi>

                     <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was ſharpely reproued by Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> in a booke written againſt him, and hath beene euer ſince vnto this day, eſteemed a wicked hereticke, for denying prayer to Saintes, and honour to be donne vnto their Relikes: And yet, what pointe of Doctrine is more currant among the Proteſtants, then this.</p>
                  <p>In like ſorte, one <hi>Aerius</hi> to the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie, added this of his owne; <hi>That we must not pray for the ſoules of our friendes departed;</hi>

                  <p>A common cuſtome it was of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and of other more auncient heretikes, to reject all Traditions, and to rely only vppon the written word,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 20 Lib 1. con.

                     <hi>Xenaias</hi> a Barbarous Perſian indeed, yet in ſhew a counterfeited Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; is noted for one of the firſt among Chriſtians, that inueyed againſt the Images of Saintes, and the worſhip donne by true Chriſtians vnto them;<note place="margin">Niceph li. 10. cap. 27.</note> as both <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> and <hi>Cedrenus in compendio</hi> doe recorde. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Iewes indeede before him, and after euen vntill this day, the
<pb facs="tcp:21661:4"/> miſcreant Turkes (enemies of all Chriſtianity) doe dwell ſtill in the ſame error: And yet is not this moſt vehemently auerred by our Proteſtants, and all <hi>Caluiniſts;</hi> although they cannot denie but that aboue 900. yeares agoe, in the ſecond generall Councell holden at Nice, they are by the conſent of the beſt, and moſt learned of the world, for euer accurſed, that doe denie reuerence and worſhippe, to be giuen vnto the Images of Saintes.</p>
                  <p>I will omitte ſundrie other heades of the Proteſtants Religion, by all approued antiquity reproued, and condemned, that I paſſe not the boundes of an Epiſtle, and ſeeme ouer tedious vnto your Majeſtie. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that theſe are ſufficient, to conuince that thoſe points (wherein the Proteſtants affirme the preſent Church of Rome, to haue ſo farre degenerate from the auncient) are the very eſſentiall partes of faith, then maintayned by the Romans: And the contrary opinions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but wicked hereſies, of old inuented, and obſtinately helde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame <hi>Roman See,</hi> euen as they are nowe in our time: and of old alſo condemned by the ſame Church in her moſt flouriſhing and beſt eſtate. Wherefore your moſt excellent Majeſtie, being reſolute in that ſingular good opinion, (that no Church ought farther to depart from the Church of Rome, then ſhee is departed from her ſelfe in her flouriſhing eſtate,) muſt needes recall the Church of England, from ſuch extrauagant opinions, to joyne with the Roman church in the aforeſaid articles, which ſhee in her beſt time helde for partes of pure faith: And in all others alſo which they cannot directly proue (in a lawfull diſputation before your Majeſtie) to haue beene altered by her, particularly naming the point of Doctrine; the author of the chaunge: the time and place, where, &amp; when he liued: who followed him, who reſiſted him, and ſuch other like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which all be eaſely ſhewed in euery ſuch reuolte or innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: becauſe the vigilant care of the Paſtors of Chriſtes flocke, haue bin alwaies ſo great, as no ſuch thinges could be vnknowne, let ſlippe, or vnrecorded.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for my firſt reaſon, collected from the vntruth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants religion.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſhall be grounded vpon the vngodlines of it, where I will let paſſe that high point of impiety, that they make God (who is goodnes it ſelfe) the author of all wicked actions, donne in the world: And will beſides ſay nothing of that their blaſphemie againſt our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, that he ouercome with the paynes of his paſſion vpon the Croſſe, did doubt, (if not diſpaire) of his owne ſaluation: being vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to touch any other pointes, then ſuch as are afterwardes diſcuſſed in this booke.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21661:5"/>
                  <p>The triumphant Citizens of heauen (who enjoy the preſence of God, and happieſt life that can be imagined) are by Proteſtants diſdaynefullie termed, <hi>Deadmen,</hi> and eſteemed neither to haue credit with God to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any thing, nor any care or compaſſion on men, among whom they once liued and conuerſed ſo kindly.</p>
                  <p>And as for the poore ſoules departed, who in Purgatory fire pay deare for their former delightes and pleaſures: they depriue them of all humane ſuccour, by teaching the world to beleeue that there is no ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>Concerning vs Chriſtians yet liuing on earth, there is no leſſe impyetie in their opinions: For they teach that the beſt Chriſtian is no better in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then a whited Sepulchre, being inwardly full of all wickednes, and miſchiefe; and onlie by an outwarde imputation of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> righteouſnes vnto them, are accepted of God for juſt. To thinke that there is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the ſoule of Man, any ſuch grace of God, as doth cleanſe it from ſinne, and make the man juſt in his ſight; is with them, to raze the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Religion, and to make Chriſt, a <hi>Pſeudochriſt:</hi> wherein, I knowe not whether they be more enuious againſt the good of Man, then they are injurious, eyther to the ineſtimable value of Chriſtes bloud, as though it coulde not deſerue any better eſtate for his fauourites: or vnto the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacie of the holy Ghoſt; as not being able (by likeliehood) to purge mens ſoules from ſinne, and endue them with ſuch Heauenlie qualities. I omitte the diſgrace thereby donne to the Bleſſed God-head it ſelfe, making the <hi>Holie of Holies,</hi> rather willing to couer and cloake our iniquitie, then to cure it: And contrarie to his infinite goodnes, to loue them whom he ſeeth defiled with all maner of abhominations.</p>
                  <p>Vnto theſe paradoxes, impious againſt God, and ſlaunderous to Man. If it will pleaſe your Majeſtie to adde, the prophane carnallity of ſome other points of the Proteſtant Doctrine; you will (doubtles) in ſhort time loath it. As for example: That it is as good &amp; godlie, by eating, to feede the body, as to chaſtize it by faſting. That it is as holy, to fulfill the fleſhly deſires of it by Mariage, as by Continencie, to mortifie them; yea that it is flatte againſt the word of GOD to vowe Virginitie: And alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his bleſſed will to beſtowe our goodes on the poore, and to giue our ſelues wholy to prayer, and faſting. All which, this Aduocate of the Engliſh Congregation teacheth expreſlie.<note place="margin">Pag. 132. 162. 166.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is this the purity of the Goſpell? Or is it not rather the high way to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picuriſme,</hi> and to all worldly vanity, and iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>I need not joyne hereunto, that they teach it to be impoſſible to keepe Gods Commaundements; and therefore in vaine to goe about it: And farther, that the beſt worke of the righteous man, is defiled with ſinne. Wherefore, as good for him to leaue all vndone, as to doe any.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:21661:5"/>
                  <p>Nay, if this poſition of others were true, it would followe neceſſarily, that all men were bound vnder payne of damnation, neuer to doe any good deede, ſo long as they liue: for that their good deede being ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſinne, cannot but deſerue the hyre of ſinne, which according to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is: <hi>Death euerlaſting.</hi> If your Majeſties important affaires,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> would once permitte you to conſider maturely of theſe impieties, and many other like abſurdities, wherewith the Proteſtant Doctrine is ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed: I dare be bold to ſay that you would ſpeedely either commaund them, to reforme themſelues, and amend their errors; or fairly giue them their <hi>Congie.</hi> I will cloſe vp this my ſecond reaſon, with this <hi>Epiphoneme. That it is impoſſible for a Proteſtant, firmely cleauing to the groundes of his owne Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to hope for anie ſaluation.</hi> For they doe, and needes muſt graunt, that no man can be ſaued without a liuely faith; and alſo that a liuely faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without charity, for otherwiſe it were dead: Now then to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; No Proteſtant can haue charity: for as witneſſeth S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Epiſ. cap. 5. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the charitie of God, that we keepe his commaundements.</hi> But it is impoſſible (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proteſtants) to keepe the commaundements: therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo impoſſible to haue charity; <hi>Which is the fulnes of the lawe:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible to haue a liuely faith, which cannot be without charity. And ſo finally through want of that liuely feeling faith, whereby they ſhould lay hold on Chriſts righteouſnes, to hale and apply that vnto themſelues, they can haue no hope at all, of any fauour, and grace at Gods handes: Without which they muſt needes aſſure themſelues of eternal damnation, in ſteede of their pretended certayntie of ſaluation. To theſe two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, gathered out of the treatiſe following, I adde a third, collected from theſe your owne memorable wordes related in the aboue named confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: <hi>viz. Are we nowe come to that paſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 69.</note> 
                     <hi>that we must appeache</hi> Conſtantine <hi>of Poperie and ſuperſtition?</hi> Which argueth that your Majeſtie judgeth them, to haue litle regard of either piety or ciuility, that would admit ſuch a thought into their mind, as that the firſt Chriſtian Emperour (our moſt renowmed countriman, ſhould be nouſled &amp; brought vp in ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherein your Majeſtie hath great reaſon, for he was moſt carefully inſtructed, &amp; taught the Chriſtian Religion, by ſuch holy Confeſſors, whoſe ſincerity in faith had bin tried in the hotte furnace of many ſtrange perſecutions: And he farther had the good happe to ſee, and heare together in the firſt generall Councell of Nice, many of the holieſt, and beſt learned Biſhops of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome. Therefore, is it moſt vnlikely that ſo Royall a Perſon, deuoted to Religion, and hauing ſo good meanes to attayne to the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, as no man could haue better; ſhould neuertheleſſe in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt time of it, be miſ-ledde into errour, and ſuperſtition. If then, it may be proued, that this moſt Chriſtian Emperor (the glittering ornament of our
<pb facs="tcp:21661:6"/> noble Iland) did beleeue ſuch articles of the preſent Roman Church, as the Proteſtants teach not to be beleeued: Will not your Majeſtie rather joyne in faith with ſo peerles a Prince, who by the conſent of all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was for certayne right well enformed, then with theſe, whome (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les) moſt men deeme to be pittifully deceiued? Nowe that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was of the ſame opinion, in matter of Religion, with the preſent Church of Rome, may euidently be gathered out of this that followeth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he was ſo affectionate vnto the ſigne of the Croſſe, that he would haue it gloriouſly appeare, both abroade in his banners, and at home in his Pallace:<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vita Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan. lib. 3. cap. 2.

                  <p>With faſting and other corporall affliction, he chaſtized his body, that he might pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>He with incredible admiration, honoured profeſſed Virgins, and made lawes in their fauour.</p>

And was ſo farre from taking vpon him to be ſupreame judge, in cauſes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall; that he openly there profeſſed, that it did not belong to him to

                  </p>
                  <p>If then this right Puiſſant Emperour, and moſt ſincere Chriſtian, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, and beleeued that there was power in Prieſts to remitte ſinnes, that Saints were to be prayed vnto, and that prayer was to be made for the dead, and ſuch like, as appeareth by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident teſtimonie, of moſt approued Authors, that liued with him: hath your Majeſtie any cauſe to doubt, but that in matters of faith, he agreed with the preſent Roman Church? Wherefore my hope and truſt in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is, that you in your high wiſdome, vpon mature and due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how many old condemned errors the Proteſtants hold; and with all well weighing that the whole frame of their Doctrine tendeth to the diſgracing of God, and his Saints, to the diſcouragement of men, from well doeing, and doth (as it were) looſen the reines vnto all fleſhly liberty: will in time make a moſt Godly reſolution, to imitate that famous Emperour <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> He contrary to his former education, embraced with all his power that ſame Romane Religion, which we nowe profeſſe: And (which is worthy to be obſerued) he feared nothing the contrary diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the multitude, or greater parte of his ſubjects, that were wholy ledde another way. But following the bleſſed example of his moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Mother S. <hi>Helena,</hi> repoſed himſelfe in the powrefull aſſiſtance of the Almighty, and chaſed all other Religions into corners, ſetting vp and firmely eſtabliſhing the Roman. There can be no cauſe aleadged, why your Majeſtie may not doe the like, if it ſhall pleaſe God effectually to ſtirre vp your gratious minde, and to bende your hart to vndertake it: for at that time there was more likelyhoode of reſiſtance, then nowe: and nowe much more helpe at hand, if any reſiſtance ſhould be offered.</p>
                  <p>Pardon me deare Soueraigne, if before I finiſh this argument, I ſeeme ouer-bold here to preſent vnto your memorie, that all your moſt gratious and Godly Progenitors, and all our holy Predeceſſors, who now (aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly) ſtande before the tribunall of God; doe demaund and expect no leſſe at your handes. For they founded not Biſhopricks, Deaneries, and other ſpirituall liuinges: they builded not Colleges, and Schooles, for Proteſtants or their fauourers. Ponder well therefore I beſeech your Majeſtie, whether they doe not, or may not juſtly chalenge of you, (to whome the adminiſtration of juſtice belongeth,) to ſee and prouide: that ſuch Churches, Church-liuinges, and ſpirituall rewardes of learning, as they erected and bequeathed to Roman Biſhops, and Prieſtes, be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, and beſtowed according to their erections, and foundations. If it ſhall pleaſe the Proteſtants to erect any new Churches, or beſtowe any other reuennues towardes their Miniſters mayntenance, let them haue them hardly, and enjoy them quietly: only let them be content, out of
<pb facs="tcp:21661:7"/> their equitie: to leaue vs that which was prouided for vs, and bequeathed vnto vs by our moſt Religious Aunceſtors.</p>
                  <p>If all theſe reaſons, and exceeding manie other which might be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and produced to the ſame purpoſe, will not ſuffice to effect in your Majeſtie, a loue and deſire, to embrace that auncient Roman faith, which all your Renowmed Progenitors, ſo highly reuerenced, loued, and eſteemed. Yet let me (proſtrate on my knee) moſt humbly beſeech your highnes, in the name of thowſandes: that ſo farre forth they may preuaile with you, as you will not permitte thoſe rigorous lawes, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt recuſant Catholikes, to be put in practize and executed. For howe can it ſeeme conformable to reaſon, in your Majeſties deepe wiſdome, and judgement? that your louing Subjects ſhould by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion and conſtrainte, vnder that intollerable penaltie of loſſe of all their goodes, conforme them ſelues to ſuch articles of Religion, that by the pureſt antiquitie were cenſured to be erronious and execrable? And what miſery, and pitty were it, to driue them perforce, either to ſwallowe downe the deadly poyſon of their ſoules, or elſe to endure beſides the diſgrace of the ſtate, the loſſe of their worldly wealth and liberty. Conſider, and weigh with your ſelfe, my moſt gratious Liege, whether it will not be thought ouer great ſeuerity, to preſſe men (euen againſt humane nature and condition,) with patience to heare their owne profeſſion and beleefe, both vntruely ſlaundered, and moſt bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyled and inueighed againſt: as in moſt Miniſters ſermons it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yea to giue patient eare to them that bluſh not publikely, to call our bleſſed Sauiours body in the holy SACRAMENT, an abhominable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole; his glorious and immortall Saintes, ſenceles dead Men; his Vicar and Vicegerent on earth <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and euery Catholike an Idolater. With infinit other intollerable reproaches; Our conſtant hope, euen yet, (though againſt hope) is, that your Majeſtie out of your owne ſweet naturall diſpoſition, and moſt milde carriage in gouernment hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, will not onely moderate, but ſuſpende all ſuch extreamity: And not ſuffer it to be extended againſt them, who in former doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full times, were (in manner) the only men, that defended and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the world, your Title and intereſt to the Crowne of England; and were no leſſe willing to receiue you, when the time came: and as forward to haue aſſiſted you (if neede had required) as anie ſorte of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectes within the lande. And neuer ſince wittingly offended your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſtie in any thing. It may be objected that they doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues vnto a ſtatute lawe, made againſt their Religion: Be it ſo. Then their Religion toward God, not any contempt of their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Superiour, doth commaund them from the conformity, which is
<pb facs="tcp:21661:7"/> pardonable. Conſidering that they be no inuenters, or followers of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, but onely hold on and perſeuere in the faith of their forefathers. And what ſubject is the among the moſt duetifull, that doth not often tranſgreſſe and giue offence to one ſtatute lawe or other: yet for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawe, men are ſo hardly dealt withall, albeit they violate many of them together. Only Catholikes are for the tranſgreſſing of one, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peled and handled as though they were ſome haynous rebbels, and traytors: Who (be it ſpoken without diſparagement to others) are (by them that liue neare them) eſteemed commonly, the moſt orderly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectes; as true of their wordes, as ſound in their deedes, of as greate charity and hoſpitality towardes their neighbours, and compaſſion of the poore: briefly, of as moderate and ciuile carriage and behauiour, as moſt men in their Country: So that to begger and vndoe them (as the execution of that lawe eſtabliſhed, muſt needes doe the poorer ſorte of them,) would be litle leſſe then vndoe and deſtroy all good order, and Diſcipline in the common weale.</p>
                  <p>Before I make an end, I beſeech your Majeſtie, that the old worthy ſaying of <hi>Caſſian</hi> may diligently examined: <hi>Cui bonum?</hi> For whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, to what end and purpoſe muſt ſuch numbers of moſt ciuill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectes, be ſo grieuouſly moleſted? What is the cauſe, why your peaceable and joyfull gouernment, ſhould be ſo mingled with ſuch bitter ſtormes of perſecution. Is it to extinguiſh the Catholike faith? It lyeth not in mans power to ſuppreſſe and deſtroy that, which the Almighty ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and maintayneth.<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt the Catholike Church.</hi> And let but thoſe graue &amp; wiſe counſailers, (who haue mannaged the ſtate in our late Queenes dayes) enforme your Majeſtie whether all thoſe terrible perſecutions that then were moſt vehemently purſued, did any whitte at all, diminiſh the number of recuſantes: or rather did not greatly multiply and encreaſe them, from one at the firſt to an hundred and moe in continuance. But it may be, they entende by thoſe penall lawes, to enrich your Majeſtie, and to fill your coffers: Surely the receipts will fall out much to ſhort, to grow to any ſuch reckoning. And what delight to enrich your treaſury, and ſtuffe your coffers with regrets, and out cries of the husband, wife, children, widowes, and poore infantes, when as the beſt and moſt aſſured treaſury of a King, (is by the prudent eſteemed) to conſiſt in the loue, and harty affection of his people? Or are theſe penall lawes, and forfaitures ordayned for rewardes vnto ſuch dependents, as for theſe or the like do follow you? But the reuennues, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, &amp; offices, belonging to your crowne of England, are abundantly able to content and reward them, that ſhall deſerue well of the common weale, without that ſo heauy agrieuance and hart bleeding of others your
<pb facs="tcp:21661:8"/> Majeſties good ſubjectes. And your Majeſties high wiſdome, and long experience in gouernment, can beſt remember you, that ſuch men are not ſo mindefull of benefits receiued, as the daylie want and miſerie, will continually renue and reuiue the memorie of the oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>And when they ſhall ſee no hope of remedie, the ſtate being nowe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and a continuall poſterity like to enſue of one nature and condition: God knoweth what that forceable weapon of neceſſitie may conſtrayne and driue then vnto at length.</p>
                  <p>If then there be no greater reaſon of waight and moment, why ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and well deſeruing Subjects, ſhould be ſo greeuouſly afflicted for their conſcience. Let others conceiue as they ſhall pleaſe, I will neuer ſuffer my ſelfe to be perſwaded, that your Majeſtie will euer permitte it, before I ſee it donne: If it be further objected, why ſhould not your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie aſwell puniſh Catholikes in your Kingdomes, as Catholikes doe Proteſtants in ſome other Countries: I anſwere, that in all Countries where multitudes of both ſortes are mixed, as it is in England: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are tollerated, as in France, Polonia, Bohemia, the Catholike ſtates of Germanie, and Cantounes, according to that of the Goſpell. <hi>Suffer both the wheate and cockle to growe vntill harueſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> In Spaine, and Italie, where ſcarſe any Proteſtants be, the caſe is otherwiſe. But what is that to England? Where are very many Catholike Recuſants, and Catholikely affected in euery degree, not only of the Temporalty, but in the Clergie alſo, hardly of the higheſt degrees of honour to be excepted: therefore for their number and quality to be tollerated.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if there were no other cauſe, but the innumerable benefittes which euery degree and order of men throughout England, haue, and doe daily receiue from our moſt Catholike Aunceſtors: As the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſo many holſome lawes; founding of ſo many honourable, and rich rewardes of learning, as Biſhoprickes, Cathedrall Churches, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, Arch-deaconries, Reſidencies, Prebendes, and Benefices: the erecting, and building, of ſo goodly Schooles, Colledges, and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles, and endowing of them with ſo ample poſſeſsions, which all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of the bowelles of the true wiſedome, pietie, and vertue of their Catholike Religion: Is not this much more then a ſufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue why their heires in faith, ſhould be moſt benignely, and louingly dealt with? and not for the profeſsion of the ſame Religion, ſo ſeuerely afflicted? Let the Proteſtants in thoſe countries, where they are moſt moleſted, appeare and ſhew, that their predeceſſors in beliefe, haue beene ſo beneficiall vnto the publike weale: And I dare vndertake, that for their Aunceſtors ſake, they ſhall finde much more fauour, then wee ſue for. Wherefore they can haue no juſt cauſe, to repine at your Majeſties
<pb facs="tcp:21661:8"/> goodnes, if vpon men of that Religion, which hath beene ſo beneficiall vnto your whole Realme, you take extraordinary compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>It lying then in your Majeſties free choiſe and election, whether you will enlarge and extend your Royall fauour, vnto an infinite number of your moſt dutifull and affectionate Subjects, who are the moſt vnwilling in the world to tranſgreſſe any one of your lawes, were they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto compelled by the lawe of God: or elſe vtterly to beggar and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, both them, and theirs, for their conſtant profeſſion of the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Roman faith. My confidence in the ſweet prouidence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is, that he will mercifullie incline your Royall heart, to chooſe rather to pardon, then to puniſh; becauſe the way of mercie, conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth better with your kinde and tender nature: it is of better aſſurance to continue your peacible and proſperous Raigne: it will purchaſe mercie at Gods hands, according to his owne promiſe. <hi>Bleſſed be the mercifull,</hi>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE READER,</hi> I meane not here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayne thee with many wordes: the principall cauſe that moued me to write, was the honour and glory of God, in defence of his ſacred verity, then the imploying of his talent beſtowed vpon me: as well to fortifie the weaker ſort of Catholikes in their faith, as to call backe and leade others (who wander vp and downe like to loſt ſheepe, after their owne fancies) into the right way.</p>
                  <p>I tooke in hand particularly the confutation of this booke, not onely for that I was thereunto requeſted, by a friend of good intelligence and iudgement, who thought it very expedient: but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe peruſing of it, I found it penned more Schollerlike, then the Proteſtants vſe to doe ordinarily: For firſt the pointes in controuerſie, are ſet downe diſtinctly, and for the moſt part truely. Afterward in confirmation of their opinion, the chiefe arguments are produced from both Scriptures, Fathers, and reaſon: Which are not vulgar, but culled out of their Rabbins, <hi>Luther, Peter Martir, Caluin, Kemnitius,</hi> and ſuch like, though he name them not. Laſtly, he placeth ſome obiections, made in fauour of the Catholike Doctrine, and anſwereth to them aſwell as he could. And (which I ſpeake to his commendation) doth performe all this very briefly and clearly. So that (to ſpeake my opinion freely) I haue not ſeene any booke of like quantity, publiſhed by a Protestant, to contayne either more matter, or deliuered in better method. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently more apt to deceiue the ſimple: especially conſidering that he withall counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiteth to come as neare vnto the Roman Church, as his tender conſcience will permitte him, whereas in deede he walketh as wide from it, as any other noueller of this age.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I eſteemed my ſpare time beſt imployed about the diſcouering of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it were) an abridgement of the principall controuerſies of theſe times, and doe endeuour after the ſame Scholaſticall manner, without all ſuperfluity of wordes, no leſſe to maintayne and defend the Catholike party: then to confute all ſuch reaſons, as are by <hi>M.

                  <p>Read this ſhort treatiſe good Chriſtian diligently, for thou ſhalt finde in it the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and pith of many large volumes, contracted and drawne into a narrowe rowme. And read it ouer as it becommeth a good Chriſtian, with a deſire to finde out, and to followe the truth, becauſe it concerneth thy eternall ſaluation: and then iudge without partiality, whether Religion hath better groundes in Gods word, more euident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie from the pureſt antiquity, and is more conformable vnto all Godlines, good life, and vpright dealing, (the infallible markes of the beſt Religion) and ſpeedely imbrace that. Before I end this ſhort preface, I muſt intreate thy patience to beare with the faultes in Printing, which are too too many, but not ſo much to be blamed, if it be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly conſidered; that it was Printed farre from the Authour, with a Dutch compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and ouerſeene by an vnskilfull Corrector, the greateſt of them ſhall be amended in the end of the booke.</p>

                        <q>It is a pollicie of the Diuell, to thinke that our Religion, and the Religion of the preſent Church of Rome, are all one in ſubſtance, or that they may be reunited.</q>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE I am to deliuer my opinion concerning this poynt, I had neede to be enformed, what this Author meaneth by theſe wordes <hi>our Religion:</hi> For there being great diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of pretended Religions currant in the world, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Church of Rome, how can I certainlie knowe, whether of them he profeſſeth? Wherefore (good Sir) may it pleaſe you to declare, what Religion you vnderſtand, when you ſay <hi>our Religion?</hi> Is it that which <hi>Martin Luther</hi> (a licentious Fryer) firſt preached in Germany? or rather that, which the martiall Miniſter <hi>Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi> contended with ſword and ſhield, to ſet vp in Zwitzerland? or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that, which <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> by ſedition wrought into Geneua, expelling the lawfull Magiſtrate thence, and by the ayde of <hi>Beza</hi> (a diſſolute turne-coate) ſpread into many corners of France? Or if by <hi>your Religion,</hi> you meane only to comprehend the Religion now practiſed in England, yet are you farther to ſhewe, whether you vnderſtand that eſtabliſhed by the State, or the other more refined (as it is thought by many) and embraced by them, who are called Puritans, for of their leauen, ſauoureth that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of yours: <hi>That the article of Chriſts deſcent into hell, crept into the Creede by negligence;</hi> and ſome other ſuch like in this booke. Theſe principall diuiſions of the newe Goſpell (to omitte ſundry ſub-diuiſions) being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and receiued of diuerſe in England, according to each mans phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, it is meete you expreſſe, whether of them you ſpeake of, that it may be dulie conſidered, how the Roman Religion and it agree, and what vnion may be made betweene them. Now if you meane the hotchpotch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21661:11"/> and confuſion of all theſe newe Religions togither, as by the oppoſition here vnto the Church of Rome, and by the articles following may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered: then I am cleare for you in this, that there can be no more concord betweene theſe two Religions, then there is betweene light and darknes, faith and infidelity, Chriſt and Beliall. Notwithſtanding I thinke that the reaſon by you produced to proue the impoſſibility of this vnion, is of no value, to wit, <hi>that they of the Roman Church haue razed the foundation, for though in wordes they honour Chriſt, yet in deede they turne him into a Pſeudochriſt, and an Idoll of their owne braine:</hi> A very ſufficient cauſe (no doubt) of eternal breach and diuiſion, if it could be verified. But how proue you, that we Roman Catholikes, who beleeue Ieſus Chriſt to be perfect God, &amp; perfect Man, and the only Redeemer of Mankinde, make him a falſe Chriſt, and an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll? or before you goe about to proue it, tell me I pray you, how this can well ſtand with your owne definition of a reformed Catholike in your preface? There you affirme him to be <hi>a Catholike reformed</hi> to your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>that holdeth the ſame neceſſarie heades of Religion, with the Roman Church.</hi> Now, can there be any more neceſſarie head of Religion, then to haue a right faith in Chriſt? can anie other foundation be layed beſides IESVS Chriſt?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> If then your reformed Catholike muſt agree with the Roman Church, in neceſſarie heades of Religion, as you hold he muſt: either the Roman Church razeth not the foundation, &amp; maketh not Chriſt a Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochriſt, as you ſay here, or elſe you teach your diſciples very pernitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to hold the ſame neceſſary heades of Religion with it. But to leaue to you the reconciliation of theſe places, let vs examine briefly, how you confirme your paradox, <hi>that the Church of Rome maketh Chriſt a falſe Chriſt:</hi> which you goe about to proue by foure inſtances. The firſt is, becauſe the ſeruant of his ſeruants may chaunge and adde to his commaundements, hauing ſo great power that he may open, and ſhut heauen to whome he will, and binde the very conſcience with his owne lawes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be partaker of the ſpiritual kingdome of Chriſt. Here are diuerſe reaſons hudled vp in one, but all of litle moment: for all theſe ſeuerall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which the <hi>Pope</hi> enioyeth, being receiued by the free gift of Chriſt, and to be employed in his ſeruice onlie, and to his honour and glorie: are ſo farre off from making Chriſt a Pſeudochriſt, that they doe highly recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his moſt ſinguler bounty towardes his followers, without any derogation to his owne diuine prerogatiues. The particulars ſhal be more particularly anſwered in their places hereafter. Now I ſay in a word, that Chriſts Vicar cannot change any one of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, nor adde any contrarie vnto them: but may well enact &amp; eſtabliſh ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable vnto them, which doe bind in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience: for that power is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God to euery ſoueraigne gouernour,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> as witneſſeth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21661:11"/> 
                        <hi>Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to higher powers.</hi> And that (as it is in the 5. <hi>verſe.</hi> following) <hi>of neceſsity, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> So that to attribute power vnto one that is vnder CHRIST, to binde our conſciences; is not to make CHRIST a Pſeudochriſt, but to glorifie him, much acknowledging the power, which it hath pleaſed him to giue vnto men. In like manner, what an abſurde illation is that, from the power to open and ſhut heauen gates, which all (both Catholikes and Proteſtants, confeſſe to haue beene giuen to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles,) to inferre: that CHRIST is made a Pſeudochriſt; as who ſhould ſay, the maſter ſpoyled himſelfe of his ſupreame authority, by appoynting a ſtewarde ouer his houſholde, or a porter at this gates, he muſt be both Maſter and Man to, belike. And thus much of the firſt inſtance.</p>
                     <p>Come we now to the ſecond: It is, that we make Chriſt an Idoll, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we call him a Sauiour, <hi>yet in vs,</hi> in that he giues his grace to vs, that by our merits we may be our owne ſauiours, &amp;c. I meruaile, in whome he ſhould be a ſauiour if not in vs: What, is he the Sauiour of Angels or of anie other creatures? I hope not, but the miſchief is, that he giues grace to vs, that there by we may merite and ſo become our owne Sauiours. This is a phraſe vnheard of among Catholiks, that anie man is his owne Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, neither doth it folowe of that poſition that good works are merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; but well that we applie vnto vs the ſaluation, which is in CHRIST IESVS, by good works; as the Proteſtants auouch they doe by faith onlie: In which ſence the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth to his deare Diſciple <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tim. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>For this doing thow ſhalt ſaue both thy ſelfe, and them that heare thee.</hi> And this doth no more diminiſh the glorie of our Soueraigne Sauiours infinit merits, then to ſay that we are ſaued by faith onlie: good works no leſſe depending, if not more aduancing Chriſts merits, then only faith, as ſhall be prooued hereafter more at large in the queſtion of merits. Now that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good mens merits may ſteede them, who want ſome of their owne, may be deduced out of an hundred places of the Scriptures, namely out of thoſe where God ſayeth, <hi>that for the ſake of one of his true ſeruants, he will ſhewe mercie vnto thouſands,</hi> as is expreſſely ſaid in the end of the firſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
                     <p>In like manner I anſwere vnto your third inſtance, that for Chriſt to haue taken away by his bleſſed Paſſion the eternall payne due vnto our ſinnes, &amp; to haue left a temporall to be ſatisfied by vs, is not to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a falſe Chriſt, but a moſt louing, kinde, and withall a moſt prudent Redeemer. Wiping away that by himſelfe, which paſſed our forces, and reſeruing that to vs, which by the helpe of his grace, we wel may &amp; ought to doe: not only becauſe it were vnſeemely, that the parts of the body,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21661:12"/> ſhould be diſproportionable to the head: but alſo becauſe it is reaſonable (as the Apoſtle holdeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>) <hi>that we ſuffer here with Christ before wee raigne with him in his Kingdome.</hi> In your laſt inſtance you ſay, that we make Chriſt our mediator of interceſſion to GOD, thinking out of your ſimplicity, that therein we much magnifie him, &amp; ſing <hi>Oſanna</hi> vnto him. Whereas we hold it for no ſmall diſparagement vnto his diuine dignitie, to make him our Interceſſor; that is to pray him to pray for vs, who is of himſelfe, right able to helpe vs in all we can demaund; being aſwell God, as Man. And albeit one in thought ſingling out the humanity of Chriſt from his diuine nature and perſon, might make it an interceſſor for vs; Yet that being but a Metaphiſical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt, to ſeparate the nature from the perſon; ſince the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie (which held Chriſt to be inferior to his Father) it hath not beene practiſed by Catholikes, who alwayes pray our Sauiour Chriſt to haue mercy vpon vs, neuer to pray for vs. And conſequently make him no mediator of interceſſion, but of redemption.</p>
                     <p>And to come to your grieuous complaint, <hi>that withall his Mother muſt be Queene of heauen, and by right of a mother commaund him there:</hi> Who can ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently meruaile at their vnnaturall groſſe pates, who take it for a diſgrace to the Sonne, to aduaunce his owne good Mother? or elſe who wel in his wits, conſidering Chriſts bounty to ſtrangers and his enemies; will not be perſwaded, that on his beſt beloued mother, he did beſtowe his moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauours? For hauing taken fleſh of her, hauing ſuckt her breaſts, and receiued his nuriture and education of her in his tender yeares, and being aſwell followed of her, as of any other. Is it poſſible that he ſhould not be as good to her, as to others; vnto whome he was not at all beholding? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the verie place of a mother, requiring preheminence, before all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and ſubjects, of what dignitie ſoeuer: doth not the right rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lead vs to thinke, that Chriſt the fountayne of all wiſdome, repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the B. Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> his deare Mother with ſuch grace as ſhould make her fit for that place? it lying in his hands, and free choiſe to doe it. And therefore is ſhe trulie tearmed, of holy and learned Antiquity, <hi>our Lady and Queene, exalted aboue all quyers of Angels.</hi> That which you impute vnto vs farther, that ſhe muſt in the right of a mother commaund her Sonne, is no doctrine of the Roman Church, nor ſaid in all her ſeruice: We ſay. <hi>Shew thyſelfe to be a mother:</hi> but it is not added by commaunding thy Sonne: that is your gloſſe, which is accurſed, becauſe it corrupteth the text, for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in that place, <hi>Sumat per te preces, &amp;c.</hi> Preſent our prayers to him, that vouchſafed to be borne of thee, for vs. If any priuat perſon by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, pearcing more profoundly into the mutuall loue and affection, of ſuch a Sonne towardes ſo worthie a Mother; doe deeme her prayers as forcible in kindnes as if they were commaundements, and in that ſence
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21661:12"/> call them commaundements, according to the French phraſe. <hi>Vos priers me ſont des commandements,</hi> that may be donne without derogation to Chriſts ſupreame dignity, and with high commendation of his tender affection, vnto his reuerent &amp; beſt beloued mother. Wherefore to conclude this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, if there be no waightier cauſe then this by you here produced, why you &amp; your adherents, doe not reconcile your ſelues vnto the Church of Rome: you may ſhortly (by Gods grace) become new men. For we are ſo farre off, from making our Sauiour Chriſt a Pſeudochriſt, or from drawing one jote of excellency from his ſoueraigne power, merits, or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: that we in the very points by you put downe, doe much more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him then you do. For in maintayning the authority by him imparted vnto his deputies, our ſpirituall Magiſtrates, and of their merits and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: We firſt ſay, that theſe his ſeruants prerogatiues be his free gifts, of more grace beſtowed on whome he pleaſeth; which is no ſmall prayſe of his great liberality: And withall affirme, that there is an infinite difference betweene his owne power, merits, and ſatisfaction, and ours: Wherein his ſoueraigne honour is preſerued entire to himſelfe, without any compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now you make Chriſts authority ſo baſe, his merits and ſatisfaction ſo meane, that if he impart any degree of them vnto his ſeruants, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the honour of all from himſelfe. Whereupon it followeth inuincibly, if you vnfeignedly ſeeke CHRIST IESVS his true honour, and will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of his diuine giftes worthelie, you muſt hold out no longer, but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite your ſelfe in theſe neceſſary heades of Religion vnto the Catholike Church of Rome, which ſo highly exalteth him, both in his owne excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and in his ſinguler giftes to his ſubjects.</p>

And be you wel aſſured, that you are ſo wide from winning Catholikes by this your worke, to a better li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of your Religion: that you haue taken the high way, to lead them to a farre greater diſlike of it; by teaching, that in ſo many materiall points it

PERKINS: for it being trulie vnderſtood, is ſo farre off from terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anie one from the Catholike Roman Church, as it doth vehemently exhort all to flie vnto it, by forſaking their wicked company that are banded againſt it. For by the <hi>purple Harlot</hi> in that place is ſignified (as ſhall be proued preſently,) the Roman Empire, as then it was, the ſlaue of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and with moſt bloudy ſlaughter perſecuting Chriſts Saints: Thoſe of the Church of Rome being as neareſt vnto it, ſo moſt ſubject to that ſacrilegious butcherie. Wherefore that voice which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> heard ſay. <hi>Goe out of her my people, that you be not partakers of her ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> can haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning; then that all they who deſire to be Gods people, muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelues in faith and manners from them, who hate &amp; perſecute the Roman Church, as did then, the Heathen Emperours, &amp; now doe all Heretikes: Vnleſſe they will be partakers of their ſinnes, &amp; conſequently of their plagues. This ſhall yet appeare more plainly in the examination of this Chapter. Where I will deale friendly with my aduerſary, &amp; aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21661:13"/> him all that I can; that all being giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, which is any way probable; it may appeare more euidently, how litle he hath to any purpoſe out of this place of the Apocalipſe, whereof all Proteſtants vaunt and bragge ſo much both in their bookes &amp; pulpits. Well then I will admitte that in the 17. &amp; 18. Chapters of the reuel. by the whoore of Babilon, is vnderſtood the Roman ſtate and regiment: which in lawfull diſputations, they are not able to proue: the moſt juditious Doctor S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and diuerſe others of the auncient Fathers, with the learned troupe of later Interpreters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it of the whole corps and ſociety of the wicked: And as for the 7. hilles on the which they lay their foundation, they are not to be taken literally: The Angell of God in the very text it ſelfe interpreting the 7. heades of the beaſt, to be aſwell 7. Kings, as 7. hilles: But this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to helpe you foreward, I will graunt it you, becauſe ſome good writers haue ſo taken it. And therefore omit as impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that which you ſay in proofe of it. What can you inferre hereupon? Mary that the Roman Church is that whoore of Babilon: fayre &amp; ſoft good Sir, how proue you that? thus. The whoore of Babilon is a ſtate of the Roman regiment, <hi>ergo</hi> the Roman Church is the whoore of Babilon. What forme of arguing call you me this? By the like ſophiſtication, you may proue that <hi>Romulus</hi> &amp; <hi>Remus</hi> were the <hi>purple Harlot,</hi> which to affirme were ridiculous, or (which is impious) that the moſt Chriſtian Emperours, <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> were the whoore of Babilon, becauſe theſe held alſo the ſtate of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire and regiment, to make ſhort, the feeble force of this reaſon lyeth in this: that they who hold the ſtate, and gouerne in the ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, muſt needes be of like affection in Religion; which if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, then did Queene <hi>Mary</hi> of bleſſed memorie, and her ſiſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> carrie the ſame mindes towards the true Catholike faith, becauſe they ſate in the ſame chaire of eſtate, &amp; ruled in the ſame Kingdome. See I pray you what a ſhamefull cauill this is, to raiſe ſuch outcryes vpon. A ſimple Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician would bluſh to argue in the paruies ſo looſely: &amp; yet they that take vpon them to controule the learnedſt in the world, often fall into ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen fallacies. Well, then admitting the <hi>purple Harlot</hi> to ſignifie the Roman ſtate, we doe ſay that the ſtate of Rome muſt be taken as it was then, when theſe wordes were ſpoken of it; that is, Pagan, Idolatrous, and a hot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of Chriſtians. Such it had beene a litle before vnder that bloudy Tyrant <hi>Nero,</hi> and then was vnder <hi>Domitian:</hi> which we confirme by the authority of them, who expounde this paſſage of the Roman ſtate. The commentary on the Apocalips, vnder Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> name ſayeth, <hi>the great whoore ſometime doth ſignifie Rome, specially which at that time when the Apoſtle wrote this, did perſecute the Church of</hi> GOD: <hi>but otherwiſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In c. 178.</note> 
                        <hi>doth ſignifie the whole Citie of the Diuell.</hi> And Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> who applieth the place to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21661:14"/> Rome affirmeth,<note place="margin">Libr. 2 cont. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin.</note> 
                        <hi>that ſhe had before his dayes blotted out that blaſphemie written in her forehead,</hi> becauſe then the ſtate was Chriſtian, which before had beene Heathen: ſo that vnto the partie Pagan, and not vnto the Church of God, he aſcribeth theſe works of the wicked Harlot: which alſo the very text it ſelfe doth conuince:<note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> for it hath <hi>That ſhe was drunke with the bloud of the Martyrs of Ieſus.</hi> Now the Church of Rome hath not then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all men, drawne any bloud of Chriſts Saints, but in teſtimony of his truth, had powred out abundance of her beſt bloud. Wherefore it is moſt manifeſt, that the harlot could not ſignifie the Church of Rome, ſo pure and free from ſlaughter: but the Roman Empire, which was then ful gorged, with that moſt innocent and holy bloud. Againe that whoore is expounded,<note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>To be a Citie which had kingdome, ouer the Kings of the earth.</hi> But the Church of Rome, had then no kingdome ouer the earth, or any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dominion at all; but the Roman Emperours had ſuch ſoueraigne commaundement ouer many Kings: wherefore it muſt be vnderſtood of them, and not of the Church. Now to take <hi>Kingdome</hi> not properly for temporall ſoueraignty, but for ſpirituall Iuriſdiction, as ſome ſhifters doe; is to flie without any warrant, from the natiue ſignification of the word, vnto the phantaſticall, and voluntary imagination. And whereas M. PERKINS ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. that <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Rome in reſpect of ſtate, prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dominion, and cruelty againſt the Saints, is all one with the heatheniſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;</hi> he both ſeeketh to deceiue, and is greatly deceiued: he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in that he doth apply wordes ſpoken of Rome, aboue 1500. yeares agoe, vnto Rome as it is at this day: and yet if that were graunted him, he erreth foulie in euery one of his particles. For firſt, touching princely dominion, the Roman Empire held then, all Italy, all France, all Spayne, all England, a great part of Germany, of Aſia, and alſo of Afrike: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their Proconſulles, and other principall Officers in all thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, drawing an hundred thouſand millions in mony, and many other commodities out of them: Wherefore in princely dominion, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificall ſtate, it ſurmounted Eccleſiaſticall Rome (which hath not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dominion ouer the one halfe of that one kingdome of Italy) more then an hundred degrees. And as for perſecution, the Empire ſlewe, and cauſed to be ſlayne, more Saints of God in one yeare; then the Church of Rome hath donne, of reprobates and obſtinate heretikes, in 1600. yeares.</p>
                     <p>Hauing thus proued, that the whoore of Babilon, ſignifieth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſtate of Rome, and not the Eccleſiaſticall: let vs now heare vvhat you ay againſt it. Marry that the diſtinction of the Empire of Rome, and Church of Rome is fooliſh, and coyned of late to ſerue our turne: which to be farre otherwiſe, I proue out of thoſe very Authors, who doe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21661:14"/> interpret that harlot to ſignifie Rome; who are neither fooliſh, nor of late dayes: you haue heard it before out of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries. And farther, we gather it out of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> in the Epiſtle which you cite: for he hauing reſembled Rome vnto Babilon, for the multitude of the wicked, which yet remayned in it: pointeth out a more pure part, ſaying; <hi>There is in deede the holy Church, there are the triumphant monuments of the Apoſtles and Martirs, there is the true confeſsion of Chriſt, there is the faith prayſed by the Apostle, &amp;c.</hi> Be not there expreſſed two diſtinct parts of Rome? Againe, <hi>Tertullian</hi> who liued in the ſecond hundreth yeare, vnder thoſe perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, ſaith in one place, <hi>that Babilon is a figure of Rome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. cont. Iud. De pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. c. 16</note> 
                        <hi>in reſpect of her proude Empire and perſecution of the Saints.</hi> And in an other, <hi>that Rome was moſt happie for her holy Church, vnto which the Apoſtles with their bloud had poured forth their whole doctrine:</hi> ſee a playne diſtinction betweene the Heathen Empire and the holy Church of Rome; Which finally may be gathered out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God. <hi>Where the Church in Babilon coelect,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of that city, which was Pagan. You ſay (but without any authour) that Babilon there doth not ſignifie Rome, but either a city in Egipt, or Aſſyria: But <hi>Euſebius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>hiſ. c.</hi> 14. &amp; <hi>S. Ierom de Eccleſ. ſcript. verſ. Marcus,</hi> with other Authors more worthy of credit, doe expounde it of Rome. And you your ſelues take Babilon for Rome, where you thinke that any hold may be taken againſt it, as in the 17. of the reuel. but in S. <hi>Peters</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle they wil none of it, becauſe it would proue too playnlie, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had beene at Rome.</p>
                     <p>Well, M. PERKINS is content in fine, to allowe of that diſtinction, <hi>of Heatheniſh and Eccleſiaſticall Rome,</hi> which before he eſteemed ſo fooliſh: And then will proue that not the Heatheniſh, but Eccleſiaſticall Rome is reſembled to the <hi>purple Harlot.</hi> See what confidence this man hath in his owne ſhutle wit, that now will proue this, and ſhorty after diſproue it: but let vs giue him the hearing in the 3. <hi>verſe.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> The holy Ghoſt ſayeth playnely, <hi>that ſhe hath made all the world drunke with the wine of the wrath of her fornication,</hi> and yet addeth: <hi>that ſhe hath committed fornication with the Kings of the earth:</hi> But this cannot be vnderſtood of heatheniſh Rome, for that left all the Kingdomes of the earth vnto their owne Religion and Idolatry: and did not labour to bring them, to worſhippe the Roman Gods. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it muſt be vnderſtood of Papall Rome. I anſwere. The Roman Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head and principall promoter of all kinde of Idolatrie, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning, and aduancing them, that moſt vehemently oppoſed themſelues againſt the Chriſtian Religion; who with any ſhewe of reaſon can deny, but they chiefly committed ſpirituall fornication with the Kings of the earth, if not by perſwading them to forſake their owne falſe Gods, which the Pagan Romans worſhippe aſwell as they: Yet by encouraging and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21661:15"/> commaunding them to perſeuer in that filthy Idolatry, and to reſiſt, and oppreſſe the Chriſtians whereſoeuer. Neither is that true that the Roman Emperours did not labour to bring other Nations to worſhip new Gods, when <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> would be worſhipped as Gods, and for feare of <hi>Adrian,</hi> one <hi>Antinous</hi> his ſeruant, was worſhipped as a God of all men: as <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> Martyr teſtifieth in his Apol. to <hi>Antonine.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Euſeb. li. 4. ist. cap. 8.</note> Theſe wordes of the text then, agree very well with the Emperours, who both were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the chiefe Patrons of Idolatry: but can in no ſorte be applied to the Roman Church, which was then (as the Proteſtants cannot deny) a pure Virgin, and moſt free from all ſpirituall fornication. But that it is now become Idolatrous, M. PERKINS doth proue by his ſecond reaſon, gathered alſo (I warrant you, right learnedly) out of the text it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Cap. 17. verſ. 16.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>that the tenne Hornes, which ſignifie tenne Kinges, ſhall hate the whoore, and make her deſolate and naked:</hi> which (as he ſaith) muſt be vnderſtood of Popiſh Rome: For whereas in former times, al the Kings of the earth did ſubmitte themſelues, to the whoore: now they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to withdrawe themſelues, &amp; to make her deſolate: as the Kinges of Bohemia, Denmarke, Germany, England, Scotland, and other parts. In theſe his wordes is committed a moſt foule fault, by groſſe ouerſight and ignorance in the verie text. What, be England, Scotland, Denmarke, (as for Bohemia ruled by a Catholike Emperour it muſt be omitted, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many ſtates of Germanie,) be theſe Kingdomes your principall pillers of the newe Goſpell, comprehended within the number of the ten, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned there in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> which hate the harlot. Yes marie. Why then they are enemies of Chriſt, and Satans ſouldiers; for in the 13. <hi>verſe.</hi> it is ſaid of theſe, <hi>that they ſhall deliuer their power vnto the beaſt,</hi> (which ſignifieth either the Diuell or Antichriſt,) <hi>&amp; ſhall ſight with the Lambe, &amp; the Lambe ſhall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, becauſe he is Lord of Lordes, &amp; King of Kinges.</hi> Is not this doating in an high degree, to infame ſo notoriouſly them, of whom he would ſpeake moſt honour? and to make the ſpeciall Patrons of their new Goſpell, the Diuels Captaines, and fiercelie to wage battaile againſt CHRIST IESVS. See, how heate of wrangling blindeth mens Iudgements. But you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. that we further hold, that the bloud of the Saintes and Martirs, was not ſhedde in Rome, but in Ieruſalem. Here is a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Men, and matters; for we ſay that the bloud of many Saintes, rehearſed in the Apoc. was ſhedde in Rome,<note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note> by the tirannicall Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, but the martiring of thoſe two principall witneſſes, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> (recorded in the eleauenth of the ſame) ſhall be at Ieruſalem, aſwell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the text is very plaine for it;<note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> ſpecifying <hi>that their bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreets of that great Citty, where their Lord was crucified;</hi> as for that the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie interpreters of that place doe ſo take it. But M. PERKINS holdeth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21661:15"/> that the place where Chriſt was crucified, ſignifieth here not Ieruſalem, but Rome; becauſe Chriſt was crucified there in his members: ſo it might aſwell ſignifie any other place of perſecution as Rome: the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being nought worth, he fortifieth it with the name of S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> but citeth in the margent a letter of two vertuous matrons, <hi>Paula</hi> &amp; <hi>Euſtochium.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epist. 17 Epist. 17</note> Good Sir, if S. <hi>Ierome</hi> had meant that the Epiſtle ſhould haue had his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he would haue ſet it out in his own name, which ſeing he thought not expedient, ſette the authoritie of it aſide, and vrge his reaſons, if you thinke it worth your labour, and you ſhalbe anſwered. In the meane ſeaſon, (I hope) all ſober Chriſtians, will take the place where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt was nailed on the Croſſe, to ſignifie rather Ieruſalem, then Rome. And conſequently, all that you haue alleadged out of Scripture, to proue the whore of Babilon to figure the eccleſiaſticall ſtate of Rome, not to bee worth a ruſh. Now let vs come to the auncient and learned men, whome you cite in fauour of your expoſition. The firſt is S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> who ſaieth, that <hi>they are the miniſters of Chriſt, but they ſerue Antichriſt.</hi> Of whome ſpeaketh that good religious Father? forſooth of ſome offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the court of Rome. Good, who were (as he ſaieth) the miniſters of CHRIST, beecauſe they were lawfullie called by the <hi>Pope</hi> to their places, but ſerued Antichriſt; for that they behaued themſelues cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly in their callings. And ſo this, maketh more againſte you, then for you, approuing the lawfull officers of Rome, to be Chriſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. The ſecond place is alleadged out of him yet more impertinently, your ſelfe confeſſing preſently, that thoſe wordes were not ſpoken of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but of his enemy: The reaſon yet there ſet downe, pleaſeth you exceedingly: which you vouch ſo clearly that it ſeemeth to beare flat againſt you; for you inferre that that <hi>Pope,</hi> and all others ſince that time be vſurpers, out of this reaſon of Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> Becauſe forſooth, that the Antipope called <hi>Innocentius,</hi> was choſen by the King of Almaine, France, England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their whole cleargy, and people. For if <hi>Innocentius</hi> were an Antichriſt and vſurper, becauſe he was elected by ſo many Kings and people: then belike he that had no ſuch election, but is choſen by the Cardinals of Rome only is true <hi>Pope.</hi> This, your wordes declare, but your meaning (as I take it) is quite contrary. But of this matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of election ſhall be treated hereafter, if neede require; It ſufficeth for this preſent, that you finde no reliefe at all in Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> touching the mayne point, that either the <hi>Pope,</hi> or Church of Rome, is Antichriſt. And all the world might meruaile, if out of ſo ſweete a Doctor, and ſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> anie ſuch poiſon might be ſucked:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Conſ. ad Fugea.</note> ſpecially weighing well, what he hath written vnto one of them, to whome he ſpeaketh thus. <hi>Goe to, let vs yet enquire more diligently, who thou art, and what perſon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21661:16"/> thou beareſt in the Church of God, during the time. Who art thou? A great Priest, the higheſt Biſhoppe: thou art the Prince of Biſhops, the heire of the Apoſtles, and in dignity,</hi> Aaron, <hi>in authority,</hi> Moyſes, <hi>in Power,</hi> Peter, <hi>thou art he to whome the Keyes were deliuered, to whom the ſheepe were committed: There are indeede al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo other Porters of Heauen, and Paſtors of flockes; but thou art ſo much the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as thou haſt inherited a more excellent name aboue them: they haue their flocks allotted to them, to each man one: but to thee all were committed, as one flocke, to one man: thou art not only Paſtor of the ſheepe, but of all other Paſtors, thou alone art the Paſtor.</hi> And much more to this purpoſe, which being his cleare opinion of the <hi>Pope,</hi> how abſurd is it, out of certayne blinde places, &amp; broken ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of his to gather, that he thought the <hi>Pope</hi> of Rome to bee neither ſheepe, nor Paſtor of Chriſts Church, but verie Antichriſt himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>There is a groſſe fault, alſo in the Canon of <hi>Pope Nicolas</hi> as he citeth it: <hi>that the Popes was to be created by the Cardinals, Biſhops of Rome.</hi> As though there were ſome 30. or 40. Biſhops of Rome at once, but of the matter of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction elſe where.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS hauing lightly skirmiſhed with a broken ſentence or two, out of one Catholike Authour flyeth to a late heretike, called <hi>Ioachim,</hi> and quoteth Iewell for relator of it. A worſhipfull teſtimonie of one he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, and that vpon the report of an other: &amp; he the moſt lying Authour of theſe dayes. As for the late Poet <hi>Petrarke</hi> his wordes might eaſely be anſwered, but becauſe he quoteth no place, I will not ſtand to anſwere it. But to cloſe vp this firſt combat, a ſentence is ſet downe out of the famous Martir <hi>Ireneus,</hi> that Antichriſt ſhould be <hi>Lateinos,</hi> a <hi>Roman.</hi> Here be as many faults, as words.

Fie vpon that cauſe, which cannot be vpholden and maintayned, but by a number of ſuch paltry ſhiftes. Thus come we at

PERKINS proofs, &amp; reproofs in his prologue, where we finding litle fidelity in his allegations of the fathers, badde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and foule ouerſight in the text, of holy Scripture, briefly great malice, but ſlender force againſt the Church of Rome, we are to returne the words of his theame to all good Chriſtians. <hi>Goe out of her my people.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the enemies of the Roman Church. And as our Anceſtors did the Pagan Emperours, who drewe out her moſt pure bloud, ſo let vs flie in matters of faith, &amp; Religion, from all heretikes that of late alſo ſpared not to ſhedde abundance of the ſame moſt Innocent bloud, vnleſſe to your greater condemnation, you had leifer <hi>be partakers of her ſinnes, and receiue of her plagues.</hi> And becauſe I purpoſe (God willing) not only to confute what M.

                     <p>Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> writing to <hi>Damaſus Pope</hi> of Rome, ſayeth: <hi>I following none as chiefeſt, but Chriſt, doe in participation ioyne with thy bleſſedneſſe,</hi> that is, <hi>with the chayre of</hi> Peter, <hi>I knowe the Church to be builded vpon that Rocke.

                     <p>Marke and embrace this moſt learned Doctors Iudgement, of joyning with the See of Rome, in all doubtfull queſtions: he would not truſt to his owne wit &amp; skill which were ſinguler; nor thought it ſafe to rely vpon his learned &amp; wiſe neighbours: he durſt not ſet vp his reſt with his owne Biſhoppe <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who was a man of no meane marke but the Patriarke of <hi>Antioch:</hi> but made his aſſured ſtay vpon the ſee of Rome, as vpon an vnmoueable Rocke, with which (ſayeth he) if we doe not communicate in faith and Sacraments, we are but profane men, voyde of all Religion: In a word, we belong not to Chriſt, but be of Antichriſts trayne. See, how flat contrary this moſt holy auncient Father is to M. PERKINS. M. PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS would make vs of Antichriſts bande, becauſe we cleaue vnto the

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT I be not thought captious, but willing to admit any thing that M.

Firſt then concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning free will, wherewith he beginneth, thus he ſayeth: <hi>Free will both by them and vs, is taken for a mixt power in the minde and will of man, whereby diſcerning what is good, and what is euill; he doth accordingly chooſe or refuſe the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ANNOT. If we would ſpeak formally, it is not a mixt power in the minde and will, but is a free facultie of the minde and will only, whereby we chooſe or refuſe, ſuppoſing in the vnderſtanding, a knowledge of the ſame before. But let this definition paſſe as more populer.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS. 1. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> Man muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in a fourefould eſtate: as he was created, as he was corrupted, as he is renued, as he ſhalbe glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the firſt ſtate, we aſcribe vnto mans will libertie of nature, in which he could will or nill, either good or euill; note that this libertie proceeded not from his owne nature, but of original Iuſtice, in which he was created.</p>
                     <p>In the third libertie of grace, in the laſt libertie of glorie.</p>
                     <p>ANNOT. Carry this in minde, that here he graunteth man in the ſtate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21661:17"/> of grace to haue free will.</p>
                     <p>M.P. 2. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The matters whereabout free will is occupied, are principally the actions of men, which be of three ſortes, <hi>Naturall, Humane, Spirituall. Naturall actions</hi> are ſuch, as are common to men and beaſts, as to eate, ſleepe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all which we joyne with the Papiſts, and hold that man hath free will euen ſince the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>M.P. 3. <hi>Concluſion. Humane actions</hi> are ſuch, as are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al men, good &amp; bad, as to ſpeake, to practize any kinde of arte, to performe any kinde of ciuill duty, to preach, to adminiſter Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hither we may referre the outward actions of ciuill vertues, as namely Iuſtice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Gentlenes, and Liberality, and in theſe alſo we joyne with the Church of Rome, and ſay (as experience teacheth) that men haue a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall freedome of will, to put them, or not to put them in execution. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. <hi>The gentils that haue not the lawe, doe the thinges of the lawe by nature,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2.14</note> that is by naturall ſtrength: And he ſaith of himſelfe, that before his conuerſion touching the righteouſnes of the lawe, he was vnblameable.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.6. Mat. 6.5. Ezech. 29.19.</note> And for this externall obedience, naturall men receiue reward in temporall thinges. And yet here ſome caueats muſt be remembred.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that in humane actions (he ſhould ſay morall) mans will is weake, and his vnderſtanding dimme, thereupon he often failes in them. This ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat is no caueat of the Proteſtants, but taken out of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquines.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Summe. 1. 2. q. 109. art. 4. &amp; 8.</note> And in all ſuch actions with S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (you might haue quoted the place) I vnderſtand the will of man, to be only wounded or half dead.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the will of man, is vnder the will of God, and therefore to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by it: <hi>Who knowes not this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>M.P. 4. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The third kinde of actions, are ſpirituall more neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; theſe be two fold, good, or bad. In ſinnes we joyne with the Papiſt, and teach that in ſinnes man hath freedome of wil. Some, perhaps will ſay that we ſinne neceſſarily, becauſe he that ſinneth, cannot but ſinne, and that free will and neceſſity, can not ſtand together: In deede the neceſſity of compulſion and free will, can not ſtand together, but there is an other kinde of neceſſity (or rather infallibility) which may ſtand with free will, for ſome thinges may be donne neceſſarylie, and alſo freely.</p>
                     <p>ANNOT. The example of a cloſe priſoner is not to the purpoſe, for it puts neceſſitie in one thing, and libertie in an other. The ſolution is, that neceſſary lie muſt be, is taken for certaynlie, not that a man is at any time compelled to ſinne, but his weaknes and the crafte of the Diuell are ſuch, that he is very often ouer reached by the Diuell, and induced to ſinne, but with free conſent of his owne will.</p>
                     <p>M.P. 5. <hi>Concluſion.</hi> The ſecond kinde of Spirituall actions be good as repentance, Faith, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In vvhich we likewiſe in parte
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21661:18"/> joyne with the Church of Rome, and ſay that in the firſt conuerſion of a ſinner, mans free wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curreth with Gods grace as a fellow or co-worker in ſome ſorte, for in the conuerſion of a ſinner, three thinges are required, the word, Gods ſpirit, and Mans will, for Mans will, is not paſsiue in all &amp; euerie reſpect, but hath an action in the firſt conuerſion &amp; chaunge of the ſoule: when any man is conuerted, this worke of God is not donne by compulſion, but he is conuerted willinglie, &amp; at the verie time when he is conuerted by Gods grace,<note place="margin">Serm. 15. de verb. Apoſt.</note> he willeth his conuerſion; to this end ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine, He which made thee, without thee, will not ſaue thee, without thee.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that it is certaine that our will is required in this, that we may doe any thing well, (it is not only then required in our firſt conuerſion, if it be required to all good thinges which we doe,) but we haue it not from our owne power, but God workes to will in vs. For looke at what time God giues grace, at the ſame time he giues a will to deſire and wil the ſame: As for example when God workes faith, at the ſame time, he workes alſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the will, cauſing it to deſire faith, and willingly to receiue the gift of beleeuing: God makes of the vnwilling will, a willing will, becauſe no man can receiue grace vtterly againſt his will, conſidering will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, is no will. But here we muſt remember that howſoeuer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of time, the working of grace by Gods ſpirit, and the willing of it in man goe togither: Yet in regarde of order grace is firſt wrought, and mans will muſt firſt of all be acted and moued by grace; and then it alſo acteth, willeth, and moueth it ſelfe: And this is the laſt point of conſent, betweene vs and the Roman Church, touching free will: neither may we proceede farther with them. Hitherto M. PERKINS.</p>
                     <p>Now before I come to the ſuppoſed difference, I gather firſt that he yeeldeth vnto the principall point in controuerſie, that is freedome of wil, in ciuill, and morall workes in the ſtate of corruption, and all good works in the ſtate of grace, for in his firſt concluſion diſtinguiſhing foure eſtates of man, he affirmeth that in the third, of man renued, or (as we ſpeake ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified) there is libertie of grace, that is, grace enableth mans will to doe if it pleaſe ſuch ſpirituall workes, as God requireth at his handes. Yet leſt he be taken to yeeld in any thing,<note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> he doth in ſhewe of wordes contradict both theſe points in an other place: For in ſetting downe the difference of our opinions, he ſaith: that mans will in his conuerſion is not actiue, but paſſiue, which is flat oppoſite vnto that which himſelfe ſaid a litle before in his firſt concluſion; that in the conuerſion of a ſinner, mans will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth not paſſiuely but is co-worker with Gods grace.</p>
                     <p>The like contradiction may be obſerued in the other part of libertie in morall actions: for in his third concluſion he deliuereth playnlie man to haue a naturall freedome, euen ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to doe, or not to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21661:18"/> doe the acts of wiſedome, Iuſtice, Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> and proues out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Gentils ſo did: Yet in his firſt reaſon, he affirmeth as peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily out of the 8. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the whole frame of mans hart is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all that he thinketh, deuiſeth, or imagineth, is wholy euill, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him no naturall ſtrength to performe any part of morall dutie. See how vncertayne the ſteps be of men that walke in darknes, or that would ſeeme to communicate with the workes of darknes. For if I miſtake him not, he agreeth fully in this matter of free will, with the Doctrine of the Catholike Church: For he putting downe the point of difference,<note place="margin">Page. 1</note> ſaith that it ſtandeth in the cauſe of the freedome of mans will, in ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: allowing then freedome of will with vs, in the ſtate of grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he there treateth; for he ſeemeth to diſſent from vs, only in the cauſe of that freedome. And as he differeth from <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> with other ſectaries, in graunting this liberty of will: ſo in the very cauſe alſo he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth with Catholikes, as appeareth by his owne wordes. For (ſaieth he) Papiſts ſay mans will concurreth with Gods grace by it ſelfe, and by it owne naturall power: we ſay that Mans will worketh with grace; yet not of it ſelfe, but by grace: either he vnderſtandeth not what Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes ſay, or elſe accuſeth them wrongfully: For we ſay that Mans will then only concurreth with Gods grace, when it is ſtirred and holpen firſt by Gods grace. So that Mans wil by his owne naturall actions, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in euery good worke, otherwiſe it were no action of Man: But we farther ſay, that this action proceedeth principally of grace, whereby, the will was made able to produce ſuch actions: for of it ſelfe it was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnable to bring forth ſuch ſpirituall fruite. And this I take to be that, which M. PERKINS doth meane by thoſe his wordes, <hi>that the will must bee first moued and acted by grace, before it can acte or will.</hi> Hee miſtooke vs, thinking that we required ſome outward helpe only to the will, to joyne with it, or rather, that grace did but as it were vntie the chaynes of ſinne wherein our will was fettered: And then will could of it ſelfe turne to God.<note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> Not vnderſtanding how Catholikes take that parable of the man wounded in the way, betweene Ieruſalem and Ierico who was (not as the Papiſts only ſay, but as the holy Ghoſt ſaieth) lefte halfe, and not ſtarke dead. Now the expoſition of Catholikes is not, that this wounded man, (which ſignifieth all Mankinde) had halfe his ſpirituall ſtrength left him; but was robbed of al Supernaturall riches, ſpoyled of all his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Iuſtice, and wounded in his naturall powers of both vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, and therein lefte halfe dead, not being able of his owne ſtrength, either to know all naturall truth, or to performe all morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Now touching ſupernaturall workes, becauſe he loſt all power to performe them; not being able ſo much as to prepare himſelfe conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21661:19"/> to them; he in a good ſence may be likened vnto a dead man, not able to moue one ſinger that way of grace;<note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> and ſo in holy Scripture the Father ſaid of his prodigall Son, <hi>he was dead, and is reuiued.</hi> Yet as the ſame ſonne liued a naturall life, albeit in a deadly ſinne: ſo mans wil after the fal of <hi>Adam,</hi> continued ſome what free in actions conformable to the nature of man, though wounded alſo in them, as not being able to acte many of them, yet hauing ſtill that naturall facultie of free will, capable of grace, &amp; alſo able, being firſt both outwardly moued, and fortified inwardly by the vertue of grace, to effect and doe any worke appertayning to ſaluation: which is aſmuch as M. PERKINS affirmeth. And this to be the verie Doctrine of the Church of Rome,<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> is moſt manifeſtlie to be ſeene in the Councell of Trent, where in the Seſſion are firſt theſe wordes in effect, concerning the vnableneſſe of man to ariſe from ſinne of himſelfe. <hi>Euerie man muſt acknowledge, and confeſſe, that by</hi> Adams <hi>fall we were made ſo vncleane &amp; ſinnefull, that neither the gentils by the force of nature, nor the Iewes by the letter of</hi> Moyſes <hi>lawe, could ariſe out of that ſinnefull ſtate. After it ſheweth, howe our deliuerance is wrought, and howe freedome of will is recouered in ſpeciall, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſteth, ſaying. The beginning of iuſtification, in perſons vſing reaſon, is taken from the grace of God, preuenting vs through</hi> IESVS CHRIST, <hi>that is, from his vocation, whereby without any deſert of ours we are called, that we who were by our ſinnes turned away from God, may be prepared by his grace, both raiſing vs vp, and helping vs to returne to our owne Iustification, freely yeelding our conſent vnto the ſaid grace, and working with it. So as God touching the hart of man by the light of the Holy Ghost, neither doth man nothing at all, receiuing that inspiration, who might alſo refuſe it: neither yet can he without the grace of God, by his free will, moue himſelfe to that, which is iuſt in Gods ſight.</hi> And that you may be aſſured, that this Doctrine of the Councell, is no other then that which was taught three hundred yeares before, in the very middeſt of darknes, as heretikes deeme:<note place="margin">1.2. q. 109. art. 6.</note> See what Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> one of her principall pillers hath written of this point in his moſt learned Summe. Where, vpon theſe wordes of our Sauiour, <hi>No man can come to me, vnleſſe my Father drawe him.</hi> He concludeth it to be manifeſt,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> that man cannot ſo much as prepare himſelfe to receiue the light of grace, but by the free and vndeſerued helpe of God, mouing him inwardly thereunto. And this is all which M. PERKINS in his pretended diſſent auerreth here, and goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to proue in his fiue reaſons following: the which I wil omitte, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all for vs. And if any man deſire to ſee more to that purpoſe, let him reade the moſt learned workes of that famous Cardinall, and right Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Archbiſhoppe <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nowe the very point controuerſed, concerning <hi>free will,</hi> M. PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS hath quite omitted, which conſiſteth in theſe two points, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21661:19"/> in the Councell: Firſt, whether we doe freely aſſent vnto the ſaid grace, when it is offered vs, that is, whether it lie in our power to refuſe it; And ſecondly, when we concurre and worke with it, whether we could if we liſted refuſe to worke with it. In both which points we hold the affirmatiue part, and moſt ſectaries of this time the negatiue. Of which our Authour is ſilent: only by the way in his fourth reaſon, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two textes out of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which are commonly alleadged againſt free will.</p>
                     <p>The firſt. <hi>I haue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>laboured more abundantly then all they, yet not I,<note place="margin">1.

To which I briefly anſwere, that they doe corrupt the text, to make it ſeeme more currant for them: the greeke hath only <hi>He ſun emoi</hi> which is, with me, not, which is in me, ſo that the word in true conſtruction make much more for vs, then againſt vs: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirming the grace of God, which was working with him, to haue done theſe thinges: And ſo Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> whome they pretend to follow moſt in this matter, expoundeth it. <hi>Yet not I, but the grace of God with me;</hi> that is, <hi>not I alone,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2. v. 13.</note> We graunt that it is God, but not he alone without vs, for in the next wordes before, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſayeth. <hi>Worke your ſaluation with feare and trembling.</hi> So that GOD worketh principally by ſtirring vs vp by his grace, and alſo helping foreward our will, to accompliſh the worke; but ſo ſweetely and conformably to our nature, that his working taketh not away, but helpeth foreward our will to concurre with him. Againe, the whole may be attributed vnto God, conſidering that the habits of grace infuſed, be from him as ſole efficient cauſe of them, our actions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued alſo with grace, being only diſpoſitions and no efficient cauſe of thoſe habits: but this is an high point of ſchoole Diuinitie, very true, but not eaſely to be conceiued of the vnlearned.</p>
                     <p>One other objection may be collected out of Maſter PERKINS third reaſon, againſt free will, which is touched, as he ſaith, by the holy Ghoſt, in theſe wordes. <hi>When we were dead in ſinnes.</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21661:20"/> remember what hath beene ſaid before: that albeit man in ſinne be dead in the way of grace, yet he liueth naturally, and hath free will in naturall and ciuill actions: which will of his being by grace fortified, &amp; as it were lifted vp vnto a higher degree of perfection, can then concurre &amp; worke with grace to faith, &amp; all good workes neceſſarie to life euerlaſting. (As for example,) a crab-tree ſtocke hath no ability of it ſelfe, to bring forth apples, &amp; therefore may be tearmed dead in that kinde of good fruit: Yet let a ſiance of apples be grafted into it, and it will beare apples: euen ſo albeit our ſower corrupt nature of it ſelf be vnable to fructifie to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, yet hauing receiued into it the heauenly grafte of Gods grace, it is inabled to produce the ſweete fruit of good workes:<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> to which alludeth S. <hi>Iames.

I will briefly proue, and that out of thoſe workes which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> wrote after the Pelagian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie was a foote; for in his others, <hi>Caluin</hi> acknowledgeth him to haue taught free will.

                        <hi>to conſent to Gods calling, or not to conſent, lyeth in a mans owne will.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>Who doth not ſee euery man to come, or not to come, by free will? but this free will may be alone, if he doe not come, but it cannot be but holpen, if he doe come.</hi> In an other place, <hi>that we will (doe well) God will haue it to be his and ours; his, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs; ours, in following him.</hi> Yea more: <hi>To Chriſt working in him, a man doth coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, that is, worketh with him, both his owne iuſtification, and life euerlaſting:</hi> will you here him ſpeake yet more formally for vs. <hi>We haue dealt with your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ours, as much as we could: that they would hold out and continue in the ſound Catholike faith; the which neither denieth free will, to euill or good life, nor doth attribute ſo much to it, that it is worth any thing without grace.</hi> So according to this moſt worthy Fathers iudgement, the ſound Catholike faith doth not deny free will, as the old <hi>Manichees</hi> and our newe Goſpellers doe; nor

                        <hi>Much leſſe would I ſay, that which thou lyingly doſt affirme me to ſay free will to be denied, if grace be commended, or grace to be denied, if free will be commended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nowe in fewe wordes I will paſſe ouer the objections which he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in our names. But miſapplieth them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt Obiection.</hi> That man can doe good by nature, as giue almes, doe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſpeake the truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore will them without the helpe of grace. This argument we vſe to proue libertie of will in ciuill and morall matters, euen in the corrupted ſtate of man, and it doth demonſtrate it: and M. PERKINS in his third co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion doth graunt it. And his anſwere here is farre from the purpoſe, for albeit (ſaith he) touching the ſubſtance of the worke it be good, yet it faileth both in the beginning, becauſe it proceedes not from a pure hart, and a faith vnfeigned: and alſo in the end, which is not the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwere.</hi> It faileth neither in the one nor other: for that almes may iſſue out of a true naturall compaſſion, which is a ſufficient good fountayne to make a worke morally good: faith and grace to purge the hart, &amp; are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary only for good and meritorious workes: Againe being done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the poore mans neceſſity, GOD his Creator and Maſter, is thereby glorified. And ſo albeit the man thought not of GOD in particuler: yet GOD being the finall end of all good, any good action of it ſelfe, is directed towardes him, when the man putteth no other contrary end thereunto.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Obiection.</hi> God hath commaunded all to beleeue and repent, therefore they haue naturall free will, by vertue whereof being helped by the ſpirit of God, they can beleeue. The force of the argument conſiſteth in this, that GOD being a good Lord, will not commaund any man to doe that, which he is no way able to doe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> M. PERKINS anſwereth in effect (for his wordes be obſcure) that GOD commaundeth that, which we be not able to performe, but that which we ſhould doe: Then I hope he will admitte that he will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs by his grace to doe it, or elſe how ſhould we doe it. God ſurely doth not bind vs by commaundement to any impoſſible thing, he is no tyrant, but telleth vs, <hi>that his yoke is ſweete, and his burthen eaſie.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>that his commaundements are not heauy.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> He was farre off from thinking that GOD would tie any man by lawe, to doe that which he was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnable to performe. This in the end M. PERKINS himſelfe approueth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Ob.</hi> If man haue no free wil to ſin, or not to ſin, then no man is to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21661:22"/> for his ſinnes, becauſe he ſinneth by a neceſſitie, not to be auoyded.</p>
                     <p>He anſwereth, that the reaſon is not good; for, though man cannot but ſinne, yet is the fault in himſelfe, and therefore is to be puniſhed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, I ſay that this anſwere ſuppoſeth that which is falſe, to wit, that a man in ſinne, cannot chooſe but ſinne: For by the helpe of God, who deſireth all ſinners conuerſion,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> and thereunto affordeth grace ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; a ſinner in a moment, may call for grace and repent him: and ſo chooſe whether he will ſinne or no, and conſequently hath free wil to ſin or not to ſin: And that example of a bankerupt is not to purpoſe, for he cannot when he will, ſatiſfie his creditours, who content not themſelues with his repentance, without repay of their money, as God doth.</p>
                     <p>Nowe concerning the force of this argument, heare Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> opinion. <hi>De duab. animab. contr. Manich.</hi> in theſe wordes. <hi>Neither are wee here to ſearch obſcure books to learne, that no man is worthy of diſprayſe or puniſhment, which doeth not that, which he cannot doe: for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doe not ſhepheardes vpon the downes, ſing theſe thinges? doe not poetes vpon the ſtages, acte them? Doe not the vnlearned in their aſſemblies, and the learned in their libraries acknowledge them? Doe not maiſters in the ſcholes, &amp; Prelats in the pulpits, &amp; finally al mankind through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, confeſſe and teach this?</hi> to wit, that no man is to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, becauſe he did that, which he could not chooſe but doe. Should he not then (according to S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> cenſure) be hiſſed out of all honeſt companie of men, that denieth this ſo manifeſt a truth; confeſſed by all Mankinde? How groſſe is this hereſie, that ſo hoodeth a man, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him, that be he learned, yet he bluſheth not to deny roundly, that which is ſo euident in reaſon, that euen naturall ſence, doth teach it vnto ſheepheards.

In ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne are three thinges. Firſt, the puniſhment: which is the firſt and ſecond death: ſecond, guiltines, which is the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of the creature vnto puniſhment: third, the fault, or the offending of God: vnder which I comprehend our guiltines in <hi>Adams</hi> firſt offence, as alſo the corruption of the hart, which is a naturall inclination and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21661:22"/> to any thing that is euill, or againſt the law of God. For firſt we ſay that after Baptiſme in the regenerate, the puniſhment of Originall ſinne is taken away:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 
                           <hi>For there is no condemnation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to them that are in</hi> CHRIST IESVS.</p>
                        <p>For the ſecond, that is guiltines, we further condeſcend and ſay, that it is alſo taken away in them that are borne anewe. For conſidering there is no condemnation to them, there is nothing to binde them to puniſhment. Yet this caueat muſt be remembred, namely, that the guiltines is remoued from the perſon regenerate, but not from the ſinne in the perſon. But of this more hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the guilt in <hi>Adams</hi> firſt offence is pardoned. And touching the corruption of the hart, I auouch two thinges. Firſt, that the very power and ſtrength, whereby it raigneth in man, is taken away in the regenerate. Secondly, that this corruption is aboliſhed (as alſo the fault of euerie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ſinne paſt.) So farre forth as it is the fault and ſinne of the man in whome it is. In deede it remaines till death, and it is ſinne, conſidered in it ſelfe, ſo long as it remaines; but it is not imputed to the perſon. And in that reſpect, is as though it were not, it being pardoned. <hi>Hitherto</hi> M. PER.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, we ſay not, that the puniſhment of Originall ſinne is in it, or any part of it, but rather a due correction, and as it were an expulſion of it: this is but a peccadilio: but there lurketh a Serpent in that caueat; that the guiltines of Originall ſinne is remoued from the perſon regenerate, but not from the ſinne in the perſon. The like he ſaith afterward of the fault, that it is a ſinne ſtill in it ſelfe remayning in the man till death, but it is not imputed to him, as being pardoned. Here be quillets of very ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: the ſinne is pardoned, and yet the guiltines of it, is not taken away. Doth not a pardon take away from the fault pardoned, all bond of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due vnto it, and conſequently all guiltines belonging to it? Who can denie this, vnleſſe he knowe not, or care not what he ſay: If then O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne be pardoned, the guiltines of it is alſo remoued from it ſelfe. Againe, what Philoſophy, or reaſon, alloweth vs to ſay, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour being pardoned for his offence, the offence in it ſelfe remayneth guilty? as though the offence ſeperated from the perſon, were a ſubſtance, ſubject to lawe, and capable of puniſhment: can Originall ſinne in it ſelfe die the firſt and ſecond death, or be bound vp to them? What ſenceleſſe imaginations be theſe? Againe, how can the fault of Originall ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in the man renewed by Gods grace, although not imputed? can there be two contraries in one part of the ſubject at once? can there be light and darknes in the vnderſtanding, vertue and vice in the will at the ſame inſtant? can the ſoule be both truely conuerted to God, and as truely
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21661:23"/> auerted from him at one time? is Chriſt now agreed to dwell with Belial? and the holy Ghoſt content to inhabite a body ſubject to ſinne? all which muſt be graunted contrary to both, Scripture, and natural ſence, if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the fault and deformity of ſinne to remayne in a man renewed, and indued with Gods grace: vnleſſe we would very abſurdly imagine that the fault and guilt of ſinne were not inherent and placed in their proper ſubjects, but were drawne thence, and penned vp in ſome other odde corner.</p>

                        <p>LET <hi>vs nowe come vnto the difference, which is betweene vs. The Catholikes teach, that Originall ſinne is ſo farreforth taken away by Baptiſme, that it ceaſeth to bee a ſinne properly: the effectes of it remayning, are an inperfection and weakeneſſe, both in our vnderſtanding, and will, and a want of that perfect ſubordination of our inferiour appetite vnto reaſon, as was, and would haue beene, in Originall iustice: which make the ſoule apt and ready to fall into ſinne, like vnto tinder, which although it bee not fire of it ſelfe, yet is fit to take fire: yet ſay they, that theſe reliques of Originall ſinne be not ſinnes properly, vnleſſe a man doe yeelde his conſent vnto thoſe euill motions:</hi> Maſter PERKINS teacheth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>That albeit Originall ſinne bee taken away in the regenerate in ſundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes, yet doth it remayne in them after Baptiſme, not onely as a want, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but as a ſinne, and that properly, as may be proued by theſe reaſons,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith directly:<note place="margin">1.

                        <p>This firſt circumſtance then alleaged by M. PERKINS, doth rather make againſt him, then for him. Now to the ſecond.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O wreatched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from this body of death?</hi> Here is no mention of ſinne: howe this may be drawne to his purpoſe, ſhall be examined in his argument where he repeateth it: ſo that there is not one poore circumſtance of the text which he can finde, to proue Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to take ſinne there properly: Nowe I will proue by diuers, that he ſpeakes of ſinne improperly.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, by the former part of the ſame ſentence: <hi>It is not I that doe it:</hi> All ſinnes is done and committed properly by the perſon in whome it is: but this was not done by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> ergo.</p>
                        <p>Second, out of thoſe wordes, <hi>I knowe there is not in me that is in my fleſh, anie good:</hi> And after. <hi>I ſee an other lawe in my members, reſiſting the lawe of my minde.</hi> Thus: ſinne properly taken is ſeated in the ſoule: but that was ſeated in the fleſh, <hi>ergo</hi> it was no ſinne properly.</p>
                        <p>The third and laſt, is taken out of the firſt wordes of the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in</hi> CHRIST IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS, <hi>that walke not according to the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Whence I thus argue: there is no condemnation to them, that haue that ſinne dwelling in them, if thy walke not according vnto the fleſhly deſires of it: therefore it is no ſinne properly: <hi>For the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> this is eternall damnation:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> Nowe to M. PERKINS Argument in forme as he propoſeth it. <hi>That which was once ſinne properly, and ſtill remayning in man, maketh him to ſinne, and intangleth him in the puniſhment of ſinne, and makes him miſerable, that is ſinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: But Originall ſinne doth all theſe.</hi> ergo.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Maior,</hi> which (as the learned knowe) ſhould conſiſt of three wordes, contaynes foure ſeuerall pointes, and which is worſt of all, not one of them true.</p>
                        <p>To the firſt; that which remayneth in man after Baptiſme, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Concupiſcence, was neuer a ſinne properly: but onely the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21661:24"/> part of ſinne, the formall and principall part of it, conſiſting in the depriuation of Originall iuſtice, and a voluntary auerſion from the lawe of GOD, the which is cured by the Grace of GOD, giuen to the baptiſed, and ſo that which was principall in Originall ſinne, doth not remayne in the regenerate: neither doth that which remayneth, make the perſon to ſinne, (which was the ſecond point.) vnleſſe he willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto it, as hath beene proued heretofore: it allureth &amp; intiſeth him to ſinne, but hath not power to conſtrayne him to it, as M. PERKINS alſo himſelfe before confeſſed. Nowe to the third, <hi>and intangleth him in the puniſhment of ſinne:</hi> howe doth Originall ſinne intangle the regenerate in the puniſhment of ſinne; If all the guiltines of it be remoued from his perſon, as you taught before in our Conſent. <hi>Mendacem memorem eſſe oportet:</hi> Either confeſſe that the guilt of Originall ſinne is not taken away from the regenerate, or elſe you muſt vnſay this, that it intangleth him in the puniſhment of ſinne: nowe to the laſt clauſe that the reliques of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne make a man miſerable, a man may be called wreatched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, in that he is in diſgrace with God, and ſo ſubject to his heauy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: and that which maketh him miſerable in this ſence, is ſinne: but S. <hi>Paul</hi> taketh not the word ſo here, but for an vnhappy man expoſed to the danger of ſinne, and to all the miſeries of this world, from which we ſhould haue beene exempted, had it not beene for Originall ſinne, after which ſort he vſeth the ſame word.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>If in this life onely we were hoping in Chriſt, we were more miſerable then all men:</hi> not that the good Chriſtians were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt out of Gods fauour, and more ſinnefull then other men: but that they had feweſt worldly comforts, and the greateſt croſſes, and thus much in confutation of that formall argument. Now to the ſecond.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Infantes Baptiſed, die the bodely death before they come to the yeares of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but there is not in them anie other cauſe of death, beſides Originall ſinne, for they haue no actuall ſinne:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 5. &amp; Rom. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>and death is the wages of ſinne</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>death entred into the world by ſinne.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The cauſe of the death of ſuch Innocentes, is either the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of their bodies, or externall violence: and God who freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed their liues vpon them, may when it pleaſeth him as freely take their liues from them, eſpecially when he meanes to recompence them with the happy exchaunge of life euerlaſting. True it is, that if our firſt parentes had not ſinned, no man ſhould haue died, but haue beene both long preſerued in Paradiſe, by the fruit of the wood of life, and finally tranſlated without death into the Kingdome of heauen: and therefore is it ſaid moſt truely of S. <hi>Paul. death entred into the world by ſinne.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> But the other place,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> is fouly abuſed, for the Apoſtle there by death vnderſtandeth eternall damnation, as appeareth by the oppoſition
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21661:24"/> of it to life euerlaſting: and by ſinne there meaneth not Originall, but Actuall ſinne, ſuch as the Romans committed in their infidely, the wagis where of if they had not repented them, had bin hell fire: now to inferre that Innocents are puniſhed with corporall death, for Originall ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in them: becauſe that eternall death is the due hire of Actuall ſinne, is either to ſhewe great wante of judgement, or elſe very ſtrangelie to preuert the wordes of Holy ſcripture. Let this alſo not be forgotten, that he himſelfe acknowledged in our Conſent: that the puniſhment of Originall ſinne was taken away in Baptiſme from the regenerate: howe then doth he here ſay, that he doth die the death for it?</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS third reaſon: <hi>That which luſteth againſt the ſpirite, and by luſting tempteth, and in tempting intiſeth and draweth the hart to ſinne, is for nature ſinne it ſelfe: but concupiſcence in the regenerate is ſuch:</hi> ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The firſt propoſition is not true: for not euery thing that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs to ſinne, is ſinne: or elſe the Apple that allured <hi>Eue</hi> to ſinne, had beene by nature ſinne: and euery thing in this world one way or an other tempteth vs to ſinne: according vnto that of S. <hi>Iohn. All that is in the world,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Epl. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>is the Concupiſcence of the fleſh, and the Concupiſcence of the eyes, and Pride of life:</hi> So that it is very groſſe to ſay, that euery thing which allureth to ſinne, is ſinne it ſelfe, and as wide is it from all morall wiſedome to affirme, that the firſt motions of our paſſions be ſins. For euen the very heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers could diſtinguiſh, betweene ſodaine paſſions of the minde and vices: teaching that paſſions may be bridled by the vnderſtanding, and brought by due ordering of them into the ring of reaſon, and ſo made ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues rather then vices. And that ſame text which M. PERKINS brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to perſwade theſe temptations to be ſinnes, proues the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>God tempteth no man; but euerie man is tempted,</hi>

                           <hi>when he is drawen away by his owne concupiſcence, and is allured: afterward when concupiſcence hath conceaued, it bringeth forth ſinne:</hi> Marke the wordes well. Firſt, Concupiſcence tempteth, and allureth by ſome euill motion, but that is no ſinne, vntill afterward it doe conceiue, that is, obtayne ſome liking of our will, in giuing eare to it, and not expelling it ſo ſpeedely as we ought to doe the ſuggeſtion of ſuch an enemie: the which that moſt deepe Doctor Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſifteth out very profoundly in theſe wordes.<note place="margin">Lib. 6. in Iul. cap. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>When the Apoſtle Saint</hi> Iames <hi>ſaith, euery man is tempted, being drawne away and allured by his Concupiſcence, and afterward Concupiſcence, when it hath conceiued, bringeth forth ſinne: Trulie in theſe wordes, the thing brought forth is diſtinguiſhed, from that which bringeth it forth. The damme is concupiſcence, the fole is ſinne. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence doth not bring ſinne forth, vnleſſe it conceiue,</hi> (ſo then it is not ſinne of it ſelfe) <hi>and it conceiueth not, vnleſſe it drawe vs, that is, vnleſſe it obtayne the conſent of our will, to commit euill.</hi> The like expoſition of the ſame place,

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21661:26"/> the founder of our aduerſaries Doctrine in this point: let him reade the 64. hereſie recorded by that auncient &amp; holy Biſhoppe <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> where he regiſtreth one <hi>Proclus</hi> an old rotten ſectary to haue taught, that ſinnes are not taken away in Baptiſme, but are onely couered, which is as much to ſay, as ſinne remayneth ſtill in the perſon regenerate, but is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. Which is juſt M. PERKINS, and our Proteſtants poſition.</p>
                        <p>Now let vs come vnto the argumentes, which the Church of Rome (as M. PERKINS ſpeakes) alleageth to proue Concupiſcence in the regenerate, not to be ſinne properly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

PERKINS anſwereth, that it is aboliſhed in regard of imputation, that is, is not imputed to the perſon, but remaines in him ſtill. This anſwere is ſufficiently (I hope) confuted in the Annotations vpon our conſent: in confirmation of our Argument, I will adde ſome textes of holy Scripture:<note place="margin">Iohan. 13.</note> Firſt, <hi>He that is waſhed, needeth not but to waſh his feete, for he is wholy cleane.</hi> Take with this, the expoſition of Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the great,<note place="margin">Lib. 9.

The very ſame doth the moſt learned Doctor S. <hi>Ierome</hi> affirme:<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Oceanum. Pſal. 50.</note> ſaying. <hi>How are we iuſtified and ſanctified, if anie ſin be left, remayning in vs?</hi> Againe if holy king <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay. <hi>Thou ſhalt waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then ſnowe:</hi> how can the blackenes of hell ſtill remayne in his ſoule? briefly it cannot be but a notorious wronge vnto the pretious bloud of our Sauiour, to hold that it is not as well able to purge and purifie vs from ſinne, as <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſsion was of force to infect vs. Yea the Apoſtle teacheth vs directly, that we recouer more by Chriſts grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> then we loſt through <hi>Adams</hi> fault, in theſe wordes: <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo the gift, for if by the offence of one, manie died; ſo much more the grace of God, and the gift in the grace of one man Ieſus Chriſt, hath abounded vpon many.</hi> If then we through Chriſt, receiue more abundance of grace, then we loſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> there is no more ſin left in the newlie baptiſed man, then was in <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocencie, albeit other defectes, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe remaine in vs, for our greater humiliation, and probation: yet all filth of ſinne is cleane ſcoured out of our ſoules, by the pure grace of God powred abundantly into it in Baptiſme: and ſo our firſt Argument ſtands inſoluble. Now to the ſecond.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Object. <hi>Euery ſinne is voluntary, and not committed without the conſent of man: but this concupiſcence whereof we talke, hath no conſent of man, but riſeth

                           <hi>That ſinne is ſo volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie an euill, that it cannot be ſinne, which is not voluntary:</hi> And to ſay with M. PERKINS that any want of conformity to reaſon in our body is ſinne, is ſo abſurd: that a man might (that were true) be damned from a dreame, how well ſoeuer diſpoſed he went to ſleepe: if he chaunce to dreame of vncleannes, whereupon doth enſue any euill motion in his fleſh. This pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe of ſinning without a mans conſent is ſo contrary vnto both, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſupernaturall reaſon that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> auerreth.<note place="margin">Li. de vera Relig. c. 14.</note>

                        <p>The third reaſon for the Catholikes is this: <hi>Where the forme of anie thing is taken away, there the thing it ſelfe ceaſeth: but in baptiſme, the forme of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne is taken away:</hi> ergo. M. PERKINS ſhifteth in aſsigning a wronge forme: affirming vs to ſay, that the forme of originall ſinne is the guiltines of it: which we hold to be neither the forme, nor matter of it, but as it were the proper paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following it. See S. <hi>Thomas:</hi>

                        <p>The deordination then of the will, Miſtres &amp; commaunder of all other points in man, made by the priuation of originall juſtice: is the forme of originall ſinne, and the deordination of all other parts of man, (which by a common name is called concupiſcence, as that learned Doctor noteth,) is but the materiall part of that ſinne, ſo that the will of the regenerate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by grace through Chriſt rectified, and ſet againe in good order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the lawe of God, the forme of originall ſinne, which conſiſted in deordination of it, is taken quite away by baptiſme, and ſo conſequently the ſinne it ſelfe, which cannot be without his proper forme, as the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth conuince.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Object. <hi>Laſtlie ſaieth</hi> M.

If you could ſhewe out of Gods word, that euery Miniſter hath ſuch a commiſſion from Chriſt, then had you anſwered the argument di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, which required but one warrant of Gods word: but to ſay that the aſſurance of an ordinary Miniſters word counteruailes Gods word, I can not ſee what it wanteth of making a pelting Miniſter Gods mate.

Moreouer ſuppoſe that this motion commeth of the holy Ghoſt, and that he trulie ſayeth, <hi>The Lord is God,</hi> how long knoweth he that he ſhall be able to ſay ſo truly? When our Sauiour CHRIST IESVS aſſureth vs that many be called,<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> but fewe of them are choſen to life euerlaſting.

Be it ſo; if he beleeue aright, and medle no further then with thoſe thinges, which be comprehended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the boundes of faith: But that the certayntie of ſaluation is to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is not to be begged, but proued, being the mayne queſtion, he ſayeth further that he who trulie repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth, knoweth that he repenteth: he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in deede by many probable conjectures, but not by certaintie of faith: as witneſſeth that holy perſon.<note place="margin">Job. 9.</note>

And thus our firſt Argument ſtands in his full ſtrength and vertue, that no man can aſſure himſelfe by faith of his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe there is no word of God that warranteth him ſo to doe.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is. It is no article of the creede, that a man muſt beleeue his owne ſaluation, and therefore no man is bound thereunto.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth. <hi>That euerie article of the Creede contaynes this particular faith of our owne ſaluation, namely three: Firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to beleeue in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21661:28"/> God, is to beleeue that God is our God, and to put our truſt in him for our ſaluation. Anſwere.</hi> I admitte all this, and adde more (that M. PERKINS be no longer ignorant of the Catholike knowledge of the creede,) that we muſt alſo loue him with all our hart and ſtrength: thus we vnderſtand it more fully then he: Yet finde not out that thirteenth article, <hi>Thou muſt beleeue thine owne particular ſaluation.</hi> For albeit, I beleeue and truſt in God, yet not being ſure of my loue towardes him, I am not aſſured of ſaluation, for as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> teſtifieth. <hi>He that loueth not, abideth in death.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>So I anſwere to the ſecond article, named by M. PERKINS, that is, I beleeue that God of his infinite mercie, through the merits of Chriſts paſſion doth pardon all thoſe, who being hartely ſorry for their ſinnes, doe humbly confeſſe them, and fully purpoſe to leade a newe life: that I my ſelfe am ſuch a one, I doe verely hope, becauſe I haue as farreforth as I could, to my knowledge performed thoſe thinges, which God requires of me, but becauſe I am but a fraile creature, and may perhaps not haue done all that ſo well as I ought, or am not ſo well aſſured of that, which by Gods helpe I haue done, I can not beleeue it, for in matter of faith (as you ſhall heare ſhortly,) there can be no feare or doubt.</p>
                        <p>The like anſwere is giuen to the article of life euerlaſting. I beleeue that I ſhall haue life euerlaſting,<note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> if I fulfill that which our Sauiour taught the younge man, demaunding what he muſt doe to haue life euerlaſting: to witte, if I keepe all Gods commaundements, but becauſe I am not aſſured that I ſhall ſo doe (yea the Proteſtants (though falſely,) aſſure vs that no man by any helpe of Gods grace can ſo doe.) I remayne in feare. But (ſaieth M. PERKINS) the Diuell may ſo beleeue the articles of the creede, vnleſſe we doe apply thoſe articles to our ſelues. Firſt, I ſay the Diuell knowes to be true all that we doe beleeue, and therefore are ſaid by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to beleeue, but they want a neceſſarie condition of faith, that is a Godly and deuout ſubmiſsion of their vnderſtanding vnto the obedience of faith, and ſo haue no faith to ſpeake properly. Againe they truſt not in God for ſaluation, nor indeuour not any manner of way to obtayne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as Chriſtians doe, and ſo there is greate difference betweene their beleefe in the articles of the creede, and ours.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS in his firſt exception grauntes.<note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note> 
                           <hi>That commonly men doe not beleeue their ſaluation, as infallibly as they doe the articles of the faith</hi> (yet ſaith he) <hi>ſome speciall men doe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereof I inferre by his owne confeſsion, that our particular ſaluation is not to be beleeued by faith: for whatſoeuer we beleeue by faith, is as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as the word of God, which aſſureth vs of it. Then if the common ſort of the faithfull doe not beleeue their ſaluation, to be as infallible as the articles of our creede, yea as Gods owne word, they are not by faith aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Now that ſome ſpeciall good men, either by reuelation from God, or by long exerciſe of a vertuous life, haue a great certainty of their ſaluation, we willingly confeſſe: but that certainty doth rather belong to a well grounded hope, then to an ordinary faith.</p>
                        <p>The third reaſon for the Catholikes, is, that we are bidden to pray daily for the remiſſion of our ſinnes.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> But that were needeleſſe, if we were before aſſured, both of pardon and ſaluation.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth, <hi>Firſt, that we pray daily for the remiſsion of new ſinnes committed that day.</hi> Be it ſo. What needes that, if we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſured of pardon? <hi>Marry</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe our aſſurance was but weake and ſmall, our prayer is to encreaſe our aſſurance.</hi> Good Sir, doe you not ſee how you ouerthrowe your ſelfe? If your aſſurance be but weake and ſmall, it is not the aſſurance of faith, which is as great, and as ſtrong, as the truth of God.</p>
                        <p>We giue God thankes for thoſe giftes, which we haue receaued at his bountifull handes, and deſire him to encreaſe, or continue them, if they may be loſt. But to pray to God to giue vs thoſe thinges we are aſſured of by faith, is as fond, and friuolous, as to pray him to make Chriſt our Lord to be his Sonne, or that there may be life euerlaſting to his Saints in heauen, of which they are in full and aſſured poſſeſsion. And ſo theſe three Arguments by M. PERKINS propounded here for vs, are verie ſubſtantiall and ſufficient, to aſſure euery good Chriſtian, that he may well hope for ſaluation doeing his dutie, but may not without great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, aſſure him by faith of it. To theſe I will adde two or three others, which M. PERKINS afterwardes ſeekes to ſalue, by his excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as he tearmes them. To his firſt exception, I haue anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The ſecond I will put laſt for orders ſake, and anſwere to the third firſt, which is:</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21661:29"/> eaſely ſeene: but true repentance requires beſides faith, both hope, and charitie, which are ſeated in the darke corners of the will, and can not by faith be ſeene in themſelues, but are knowne by their effects: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo vncertayne doe make but conjectures and a probable opinion, ſo that place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be omitted where he ſaith.<note place="margin">2.

                        <p>An other reaſon of this vncertayntie,<note place="margin">De cor. &amp; gra. cap 13.</note> yeeldeth Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in theſe wordes: <hi>In this place of temptation, ſuch is our infirmity, that aſſurednes, might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender pride.</hi> To this agreeth S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſaying:<note place="margin">Lib. 9. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. cap. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>If we knowe our ſelues to haue grace, we are proude.</hi> So that to ſtrike downe the pride of our harts, and to humble vs, and to make vs trauaile more carefully in the workes of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, God doth not ordinarily aſſure men at the firſt of their owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: but to cheere vp their hartes on the other ſide, doth put them in great hope of it, like to a diſcreet and good Lord, who will not at the firſt entrance into his ſeruice; infeafe his ſeruant in the fee ſimple of thoſe lands, which after vpon his good deſerts he meaneth to beſtowe on him. This is an other kinde of Doctrine, then that which M.

Becauſe we knowe that he beſtoweth mercy vpon the vnworthie, at the firſt juſtification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but will not admitte into the Kingdome of heauen any vnworthy, but giues men grace while they liue to worke, that they are made worthy of his heauenly Kingdome according to that: <hi>They ſhall walke with me in whites,</hi>

                        <p>The fift reaſon for our opinion is taken out of M.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21661:30"/> anſwere is, that prayer doth aſſure vs to perſeuer to the end: for God biddes vs pray, that we fall not into temptation, and promiſeth an iſſue forth:<note place="margin">1.

                           <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen which our Lord profeſſed to be in him ſelfe, his will is that it be hoped, for without any doubtfulnes of vncertayne will (at all,</hi> is an addition) <hi>otherwiſe there is no iuſtification by faith, if faith it ſelfe be made doubtfull.</hi> Firſt, he ſaith, but as we ſay, that the Kingdome of heauen is to be hoped for, without anie doubtfulneſſe; for wee profeſſe certayntie of hope, and deny onely certayntie of faith, as M. PERKINS confeſſeth before. And as for faith, we ſay with him alſo it is not doubtfull, but very certaine. What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21661:32"/> this to the purpoſe, that a man muſt beleeue his owne ſaluation when S. <hi>Hilary</hi> ſpeaketh there of faith of the reſurrection of the dead. His laſt Author is S. <hi>Bernard:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Epiſt. 107.</note> 
                           <hi>Who is the iuſt man, but he that being loued of God, loues him againe? which comes not to paſſe but by the ſpirit, reuealing by faith the eternall promiſe of God, of his ſaluation to come, which reuelation is nothing elſe, but the infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirituall grace, by which the deedes of the fleſh are mortified, the man is prepared to the kingdome of heauen, together receiuing in one ſpirit, that, whereby he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that he is loued, and loues againe.</hi> Note that he ſaith the reuelation of the ſpirit, to be nothing elſe, but the infuſion of ſpirituall graces, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, whereby a man hath ſome feeling of Gods goodneſſe towardes him, by which (as he ſaith) he may preſume, but not beleeue certainlie, that he is loued of God. But let S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in the ſame place interpret himſelfe, there he ſpeaketh thus, as I cited once before. <hi>It is giuen to men to taſt before hand, ſomewhat of the bliſſe to come, &amp;c. Of the which knowledge of our ſelues now in part perceiued, a man doth in the meane ſeaſon glory in hope, but not yet in ſecurity.</hi> His opinion then is expreſly, that for all the reuelations of the ſpirit made by faith vnto vs, we are not aſſured for certainty of our ſaluation, but feele great joy, through the hope we haue hereafter to receiue it.</p>
                        <p>This paſſage of teſtimonies being diſpatched, let vs now come vnto the fiue other reaſons which M. PERKINS produceth in defence of their opinion.</p>
                        <p>The firſt reaſon is, <hi>That in faith there are two thinges, the one is an infallible aſſurance of thoſe thinges which we beleeue:</hi> This we graunt, and therehence proue (as you heard before) that there can be no faith of our particular ſaluation, becauſe we be not ſo fully aſſured of that, but that wee muſt ſtand in feare of loſing of it,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> according to that, <hi>Holde that which thou hast; leaſt perhaps an other receiue thy crowne.</hi> But the ſecond poynt of faith, puts all out of queſtion. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith M. PERKINS) <hi>it doth aſſure vs of remiſsion of our ſinnes, and of life euerlaſting in particular.</hi> Proue that Sir, and we neede no more.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> 
                           <hi>It is proued out of S:</hi> Iohn: <hi>As many as receiued him, he gaue them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be made the ſonnes of God, namely, to them that beleeue in his name.</hi> This text commeth much too ſhort: he gaue them power to be the ſonnes, that is, gaue them ſuch grace, that they were able, and might if they would, be ſonnes of God, but did not aſſure them of that neither, much leſſe that they ſhould ſo continue vnto their liues end. I omitte his vnſauoury diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>beleeuing Chriſt,</hi> and applying vnto vs his benefittes, (which he might be aſhamed to make vnto vs, that admitte no part of it to be true.) I confeſſe that therein faith hath his part, if it be joyned with charity, and frequentation of the Sacraments. This is it which S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>That not by the workes of</hi> Moyſes <hi>lawe, but by faith in Christ Ieſus we receiue the promiſes of the ſpirit, and ſhall haue hereafter the performance, if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21661:32"/> thoſe thinges which Chriſt hath commaunded vs.</hi> But what is this to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Saluation? <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is the property of faith, to apply Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and proues it out of S.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>Beleeue and thou haſt eaten:</hi> Againe, <hi>Send vp thy faith, and thou maiſt holde Chriſt in heauen: &amp;c.</hi> To which,<note place="margin">Tract. 25. in Ioh.</note> and ſuch like authorities, I anſwere, that we finde Chriſt, we holde Chriſt, we ſee Chriſt, by faith, beleeuing him to be the ſonne of God, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the world, and Iudge of the quicke and the dead: and wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and diſgeſt all the myſteries of this holy worde. But where is it once ſaid, in any of theſe ſentences, that we are aſſured of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? we beleeue all theſe poyntes and many more: but we ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the neare our ſaluation, vnleſſe we obſerue Gods commaundements, <hi>The ſeruant which knowes his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 12. Ioh. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>Then you are my friends</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>when you ſhall doe the things which I commaund you:</hi> which we being vncertaine to performe, aſſure not our ſelues of his friendſhip, but when to our knowledge we goe as neare it as we can, and demaund pardon of our wantes, wee liue in good hope of it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond reaſon is, <hi>Whatſoeuer the holy Ghoſt teſtifieth vnto vs, that certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by faith we muſt beleeue: but the holy Ghoſt doth particularly teſtifie vnto vs our ſaluation:</hi> ergo, <hi>the firſt propoſition is true. The ſecond is proued thus, S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, the ſpirit of God beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God. The Papiſts to elude this reaſon, alleage, that it doth indeede witneſſe our adoption,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>by ſome comfortable feeling of Gods fauour towarde vs, which may often be miſtaken, whereof the Apoſtle warneth vs when he ſaith, beleeue not euery ſpirit, but trie the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whether they be of God or no. But</hi> (ſaith M. PERKINS) <hi>by their leaue,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>the teſtimonie of the ſpirit, is more then a bare feeling of Gods grace. For it is called the pleadge and earneſt of Gods ſpirit in our harts. And therefore it takes away all doubting, as in a bargaine, the earneſt giuen, puts all out of queſtion.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> I anſwere firſt out of the place it ſelfe, that there followeth a condition on our parts to be performed, which M. PERKINS thought wiſedome to conceale. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that the ſpirit witneſſeth with our ſpirits, that we are the ſonnes of God, and coheires of Chriſt, with this condition, <hi>If yet we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him, that we may be glorified with him.</hi> So that the teſtimonie is not abſolute, but conditionall, and then if we faile in performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, God ſtandes free of his promiſe, and will take his <hi>earneſt</hi> backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And ſo to haue receaued the <hi>earneſt</hi> of it, will nothing auaile vs, much leſſe, aſſure vs of ſaluation.</p>
                        <p>This is the direct anſwere to that place, although the other be very good, that the teſtimonie of the ſpirit, is but an inward comfort and joy, which breedeth great hope of ſaluation, but bringeth not aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This M. PERKINS would refute, by the authority of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:21661:33"/> in the place before cited,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 107.</note> ſee the place, and my anſwere there.</p>
                        <p>The third reaſon is, <hi>That which we muſt pray for by Gods commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, that we muſt beleeue: but euery man muſt pray for ſaluation,</hi> therefore <hi>we muſt beleeue that we ſhall haue ſaluation.</hi> The propoſition he confirmeth thus: in euery petition muſt be two thinges, one a deſire of the thing we aske, an other a particular faith to obtaine it, which is proued by Chriſts wordes: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you ſhall requeſt when you pray,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Marke 11.</note> 
                           <hi>beleeue that you ſhall haue it, and it ſhall be done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Argument is ſo proper for their purpoſe, that we returne it vpon their owne heades: <hi>We muſt pray for ſaluation,</hi> therefore we are not yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of it: For who in his wittes prayeth God to giue him that, whereof he is aſſured already? And a godly act of faith it is, in that prayer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God will giue that, which he is aſſured of before hand: ſuch fooliſh petitions cannot pleaſe God, and therefore after their doctrine it is to be denied, that any faithfull man may pray for his ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather thanke the Lord for it. But to anſwere directly, he who prayeth, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue he ſhall obtayne that which he prayeth for, if he obſerue all the due circumſtances of prayer, which be many, but to this purpoſe, two are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired neceſſarily: the one that he who prayeth be the true ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, which firſt excludeth all thoſe that erre in faith, touched in theſe wordes. <hi>What you of the faithfull ſhall deſire when you pray, ſhall be giuen you:</hi> The other is, when we requeſt matters of ſuch moment, that we perſeuer in prayer, &amp; continue our ſuite day by day, of theſe ſuites of eternall ſaluation, we muſt take theſe words of our Sauiour to be ſpoken.<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> 
                           <hi>We muſt alwayes pray, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be wearie.</hi> And then no doubt, but we ſhall in the end receiue it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are in doubt, whether we ſhal obſerue thoſe neceſſarie circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of prayer or no, therefore we can not be ſo wel aſſured to obtayne our ſuite, although we be on Gods parte moſt aſſured, that he is moſt bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and readier to giue them, we are to aske.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. Ioan 5.</note>But ſaith M. PERKINS, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> noteth out this particular faith, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, <hi>Our aſſurance, that God will giue vnto vs, whatſoeuer we aske according to his will.</hi> But where finde we that it is Gods will, to aſſure euerie man at the firſt entrance into his ſeruice, of eternall ſaluation? is it not ſufficient to make him an aſſured promiſe of it, vpon his faithfull ſeruice and good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour towardes him?</p>
                        <p>The fourth reaſon is, <hi>Whatſoeuer God commaundeth, that a man muſt and can performe. But God commaundeth vs to beleeue our ſaluation:</hi> ergo, <hi>we muſt beleeue it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The propoſition is true, yet commonly denyed by all Proteſtants, for God commaundes vs to keepe his commaundements, and they hold that to be impoſſible: but to the aſſumption: That God commaundes vs to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21661:33"/> beleeue our ſaluation, is proued (ſaith M. PERKINS) by theſe wordes: <hi>Repent and beleeue the Goſpell: Spectatum admiſsi, riſum teneatis amici:</hi> Where is it written in that Goſpel, beleeue your owne particular ſaluation? ſhew vs once but one cleare text for it, and we will beleeue it. I doe beleeue in Chriſt, and hope to be ſaued, through his mercy and merits, but knowe well, <hi>that vnleſſe I keepe his wordes, I am by him likened to a foole,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Math. 7. Math. 26. Math. 25.</note> 
                           <hi>that built his houſe vpon the ſandes.</hi> He commaundes me to watch and pray, leaſt I fall into temptation: and elſe where, warneth me to prepare oyle to keepe my lampe burning againſt his comming, or elſe I am moſt certayne to be ſhut out with the fooliſh Virgins. An hundred ſuch admonitions finde we in holy Scriptures, to ſhake vs out of this ſecurity of our ſaluation, and to make vs vigilant to preuent all temptations of the enemie, and diligent to trayne our ſelues in godly exerciſes of all vertue.</p>
                        <p>The fift and laſt reaſon is this, <hi>The Papiſts teach aſſurance of hope,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>euen hence it followeth, that he may be infallibly aſſured, for the property of a true and liuely hope is neuer to make a make a man aſhamed.</hi> Anſwere, hope indeede of heauen makes a man moſt couragiouſlie beare out all ſtormes of perſecution, and not to be aſhamed of Chriſts Croſſe, but to profeſſe his faith moſt bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the moſt bloudy tyrants of the world, our harts being by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity fortified and made inuincible. And this is that which the Apoſtle teacheth in that place: and ſaith before,<note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>that the faithfull glory in the hope of the ſonnes of God.</hi> And doe not vaunt themſelues of the certainty of their ſaluation. This certainty of hope, is great in thoſe that haue long liued vertuouſly, ſpecially when they haue alſo endured manifolde loſſes, much diſgrace, great wronges and injuries for Chriſts ſake, for he that cannot faile of his word, hath promiſed to requite all ſuch with an hundred folde: But what is this to the certainty of faith, which the Proteſtants will haue euery man to be endued with at his firſt entrance into the ſeruice of God. When as S. <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuateth, that godly men partakers of the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 6</note> yea after they haue taſted the good word of God, and the power of the world to come, that is, haue receiued beſides faith, great fauours of Gods ſpirit, and felt as it were the joyes of heauen, haue after all this ſo fallen from God, that there was ſmall hope of their recouerie.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Rule. <hi>That iuſtification ſtands in two thinges: Firſt, in the remiſsion of ſinnes by the merite of Christs death: Secondly, in the imputation of Chriſts righteouſnes, which is an other action of God, whereby he accounteth and eſteemeth that righteouſnes which is in Chriſt, as the righteouſnes of that ſinner, which beleeueth in him: By Chriſts righteouſnes we are to vnderſtand two thinges: firſt, his ſufferings ſpecially in his death and paſsion: ſecondly, his obedience in fulfilling the lawe: both which goe together; for Chriſt in ſuffering obeyed, and obeying ſuffered. And the very ſhedding of his bloud, to which our ſaluation is aſcribed, muſt not onely be conſidered, as it is paſsiue, that is a ſuffering, but alſo as it is actiue, that is an obedience, in which he ſhewed his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding loue, both to his father, and vs, and thus fulfilled the lawe for vs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Rule. <hi>That iuſtification is from Gods mercies and grace, procured onely by the merite of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4.

                        <p>Becauſe M. PERKINS ſettes not downe well the Catholikes opinion, I will helpe him out, both with the preparation and juſtification it ſelfe, and that taken out of the Councel of Trent. Where the very wordes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning preparation are theſe.<note place="margin">Seſſ. 6. c. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>Men are prepared and dispoſed to this iustice, when being ſtirred vp, and helped by Gods grace, they conceiuing faith by hearing, are freely moued towardes God, beleeuing thoſe thinges to be true, which God doth reueale and promiſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                                 <desc>••••</desc>
                              </gap>ely, that he of his grace doth iuſtifie a ſinner through the redemption, that is in</hi> CHRIST IESVS. <hi>And when knowledging them ſelues to be ſinners, through the feare of Gods iudgementes, they turne them ſelues to conſider the mercie of God, are lifted vp into hope, truſting that God will be mercifull vnto them for Christs ſake: and beginning to loue him as the fountayne of all iuſtice, are there by moued with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21661:34"/> hatred and deteſtation of all ſinnes. Finally they determine to receiue baptiſme, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne a new life, and to keepe all Chriſts commaundements.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this diſpoſition, or preparation, followeth Iuſtification, and for that euery thing is beſt knowne by the cauſes of it, all the cauſes of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are deliuered by the Councell in the next Chapter, which briefly are theſe. <hi>The finall cauſe of the Iuſtification of a ſinner, is the glorie of God, the glory of Chriſt, and mans owne iuſtification: the efficient is God, the meritorious,</hi> CHRIST IESVS <hi>Paſsions, the inſtrumentall, is the Sacrament of Baptiſme, the onlie formall cauſe, is inherent iuſtice, that is, Faith, Hope, and Charity, with the other giftes of the Holy Ghoſt, powred into a mans ſoule, at that inſtant of iuſtification.</hi> Of the iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, and the ſecond iuſtification ſhall be ſpoken in their places.</p>
                        <p>So that we agree in this point, that iuſtification commeth of the free grace of God, through his infinite mercies, and the merits of our Sauiours Paſſion, and that all ſinnes, when a man is juſtified, be pardoned him.</p>
                        <p>The point of difference is this: that the Proteſtants hold that Chriſts Paſſion and obedience imputed vnto vs, becommeth our righteouſnes: (for the wordes of juſtice and juſtification, they ſeldome vſe,) and not any righteouſnes, which is in our ſelues. <hi>The Catholikes affirme, that thoſe vertues powred into our ſoules, (ſpeaking of the formall cauſe of iuſtification) is our iuſtice, and that through that, a man is iuſtified in Gods ſight, and accepted to life euerlaſting. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as you haue ſeene before, we hold that God of his meere mercie through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of</hi> CHRIST IESVS <hi>our Sauiour, hath freely beſtowed that iuſtice on vs.</hi> Note that M. PERKINS comes to ſhort in his ſecond rule, when he attributeth the merits of Chriſts ſuffringes to obedience; whereas obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if it had beene without charity, would haue merited nothing at Gods handes.</p>
                        <p>And whereas M. PERKINS doth ſay, that therein we raze the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that is as he interpreteth it in his preface, we make Chriſt a Pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochriſt, we auerre, that herein we doe much more magnifie Chriſt, then they doe, for they take Chriſts merits to be ſo meane, that they doe but euen ſerue the turne to deface ſinne, and make men worthie of the joyes of heauen. Nay it doth not ſerue the turne, but only that God doth not impute ſinne vnto vs. We contrarywiſe, doe ſo highly eſteeme of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours ineſtimable merits, that we hold them wel able to purchaſe at Gods handes, a farre inferiour juſtice, and ſuch merits as mortall men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and to them doe giue ſuch force and value, that they make a man juſt before God, and worthy of the Kingdome of heauen, as ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Againe, they doe great iniury to Gods goodnes, wiſedome, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in their juſtification, for they teach, that inward juſtice, or ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not neceſſary to juſtification; Yea their Ring-leader <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith. <hi>That the iuſtified can by no ſinnes whatſoeuer, (except he refuſe to beleeue) loſe their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21661:35"/> ſaluation.</hi> Wherein, firſt they make their righteous man, <hi>Like</hi> (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſpeaketh) <hi>to ſepulchers whited on the out ſide,</hi> with an imputed juſtice, but within, full of iniquity, and diſorder. Then the wiſdome of GOD muſt either not diſcouer this maſſe of iniquity, or his goodneſſe abide it, or his juſtice either wipe it away, or puniſh it: <hi>But</hi> (ſay they) <hi>he ſeeth it well enough, but couereth it with the mantle of Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</hi> Why? can any thing be hid from his ſight? it is madneſſe to thinke it. And why doth he not for Chriſtes ſake deface it, and wipe it cleane away, and adorne with his grace that ſoule, whome he for his ſonnes ſake loueth, and make it worthy of his loue and kingdome. What? is it becauſe Chriſt hath not deſerued it? So to ſay, were to derogate from the infinite value of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Or is it, for that God cannot make ſuch juſtice in a pure man, as may be worthy of his loue and his kingdome? And this were to deny Gods power in a matter that can be donne, as we confeſſe that ſuch vertue was in our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> in ſtate of innocencie. And M.

                           <hi>That man in this life at his laſt gaſpe, may haue ſuch righteouſneſſe.</hi> If then we had no other reaſon for vs, but that our juſtification doth more exalt the power, and goodnes of God, more magnifie the value of Chriſts merits, and bringeth greater dignity vnto men: our doctrine were much better to be liked, then our aduerſaries, who cannot alleage one expreſſe ſentence, either out of holy Scriptures, or auncient Fathers, teaching the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe vnto vs, to be our juſtification as ſhall be ſeene in the reaſons following, and doe much abaſe both Chriſts merits, and Gods power, wiſdome, and goodneſſe.

                        <p>This reaſon is not worth a ruſh, for when he requireth that our juſtice muſt ſatisfie the juſtice of the lawe, I demaund what lawe he meaneth? If <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe:<note place="margin">Gal 5. Gal. 5.</note> of which thoſe wordes, <hi>Doe this and thou ſhalt liue,</hi> are ſpoken.

                        <p>If M.

                        <p>Againe, a man muſt needes haue his ſinnes pardoned, and grace giuen him, before he can make any kinde of due ſatisfaction, for he muſt be in the ſtate of grace before he can ſatisfie, wherfore he muſt needes flie to the benefit of Chriſts ſatisfaction: There is nothing like in juſtification, for firſt to make a man juſt in Gods ſight, requires no infinite perfection, but ſuch as a meere man is very well capable of, as all muſt needes confeſſe of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocencie, and of all the bleſſed Soules in heauen who be juſt in Gods ſight. Neither is it neceſſary to be infinite, for to be worthy of the joyes of heauen, which be not infinite as they are enjoyed of Men or Angels, either who haue all thinges there in number, weight, and meaſure. Briefly, it is a moſt eaſie thing for one man to pay the debts of an other, but one man can not beſtowe his wiſedome or juſtice on an other, and not credible, that God (whoſe judgement is according to truth) will repute a man for juſt, who is full of iniquity: no more then a ſimple man will take a Black-moore for white, although he ſee him cloathed in a white ſute of apparell.</p>

Or it is not infinit, but in a certayne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as he ſeemeth to graunt, and then it is no part of Chriſts infinit juſtice, for all the partes of an infinit thing, are infinit: according vnto true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. It remayneth then that a certayne limited portion of juſtice is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued out of Chriſts infinit juſtice, and powred into this, or that man, as in his owne example, <hi>The light of euery ſtarre is receiued from the Sunne beames.</hi> Yet is not the light in the ſtarre, the ſame which is in the Sun, for one accident cannot be in two ſubjects ſo far diſtant, neither is it of like vertue to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the skyes, as it is euident: but is a farre dimmer light, ſomewhat like vnto that of the Sunne from whence it came. Euen ſo in our juſtification from the Sonne of juſtice CHRIST IESVS, certayne beames of particular juſtice are conueyed into this, or that mans ſoule, whereby it is both ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by faith, and inflamed by charitie: but there is exceeding difference betweene their two juſtices, more then there is betweene the light of the ſunne, &amp; the light of a ſtarre; which S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in expreſſe tearmes deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſaying. <hi>How much differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there is betweene the light that doth lighten,</hi>

                           <hi>&amp; that which is lightened, that is the ſun &amp; the ſtarre light, ſo much difference is there between the iuſtice that doth iuſtifie, &amp; that iuſtice which is made by that iuſtification:</hi> to wit, betweene the juſtice of Chriſt, and that which is in euery good Chriſtian.</p>
                        <p>The third reaſon for the Catholike partie. If men be made trulie and really juſt by Chriſts juſtice, imputed vnto them, in like manner Chriſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21661:38"/> ſhould be made really vnjuſt, by the iniquity and ſinnes of men imputed vnto him. For there is no reaſon to the contrary, but one may aſwell be made vnjuſt by imputation, as juſt; eſpecially conſidering that euill is made more eaſelie, and more wayes then good. M. PERKINS anſwere is, that we may ſay Chriſt was a ſinner trulie, not becauſe he had ſinne in him, but becauſe our ſinnes were laide on his ſhoulders. That reaſon is naught, for he is not trulie a ſinner, that paies the debt of ſinne, which an innocent and moſt juſt perſon may performe: but he that either hath ſinne trulie in him, or is ſo by imputation ſtroken, that the ſins are made his owne really, and he in all caſes to be delt with all, as if he ſinned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: as they holde that one juſtified by imputation of Chriſts juſtice, is really in Gods ſight juſt, and is both loued in this life, and ſhall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the next, as if he were trulie juſt indeede: But to auouch our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt to be ſo a ſinner, is to ſay that he was auerted from God, the ſlaue of the Diuell, and ſonne of perdition, which is playne blaſphemy. That ſentence out of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Iſay. 53.</note> 
                           <hi>He was counted with ſinners,</hi> is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Euangeliſts, that he was ſo taken indeede, but by a wicked Iudge, and a reprobate people. And therefore if you allowe of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, range your ſelfe with them, as one of their number. S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> by him produced, confirmeth the ſame, ſaying that God permitted him to be condemned as a ſinner, not that he was one trulie. Chriſt I knowe is called ſinne by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but by a figure, ſignifying that he was a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinne, as hath beene before declared. The ſame bleſſed Apoſtle when he ſpeaketh properly,<note place="margin">Heb. 4</note> affirmeth in playne tearmes, that Chriſt was tempted like vnto vs, in all thinges excepting ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Obiect. <hi>If a man be righteous only by imputation, he may together be full of iniquity, whereupon it muſt needes followe, that God doth take for iuſt and good, him that is both vniuſt and wicked: but that is abſurd, when Gods iudgment is according to truth.</hi> Here M. PERKINS yeeldeth, <hi>That when God doth impute Chriſts iuſtice vnto any man, he doth together ſanctifie the partie, giuing original ſinne a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounde.</hi>

                        <p>The ſixt and laſt reaſon for Catholikes is, <hi>The iuſtice, of the faithfull is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, dureth after this life, and is crowned in heauen, but Chriſts imputed iuſtice ceaſeth in the end of this life.</hi> ergo.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth. Firſt, that imputed righteouſnes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with vs for euer, and that in heauen, we ſhall haue no other. Secondly, that perhaps in the end of this life, inward righteouſnes ſhall be perfect, and then without perhaps it ſhall be moſt perfect in heauen. So that one part of this anſwere, ouerthroweth the other. Wherefore I need not ſtand vpon it, but will proceede to fortifie our partie, with ſome authorities, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both forth of the Holy ſcriptures, and auncient Fathers: The firſt place I take out of theſe wordes of S. <hi>Paul. And theſe thinges certes, were you,</hi>

                        <p>The like deſcription of our iuſtification is in S. <hi>Paul. Of his mercy he hath ſaued vs by the lauer of regeneration, and renuinge of the Holy Ghoſt, whome he hath powred into vs abundantly, through</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>our Sauiour, that being iuſtified by his grace, we may be heires in hope (and not in certayntie of faith) of life euerlaſting.</hi> Where the Apoſtle inferring that being iuſtified by his grace, declareth that in the words before he had deſcribed the ſame iuſtification, to conſiſt in our new birth of Baptiſme, and the renewing of our ſoules, by the infuſion of his heauenly giftes, which God of his mercy did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe vpon vs for his Sonne Chriſts ſake.

                        <head>THE SECOND DIFFERENCE ABOVT THE MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Iuſtification.</head>
                        <p>WE all agree in generall, that faith concurreth to our juſtification, but differ in three poyntes. 1. How faith is to be taken. 2. How it worketh in our juſtification. 3. Whether it alone doth juſtifie.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the firſt poynt, Catholikes holde a juſtifying faith, to be that Chriſtian faith, by which we beleeue the articles of our Creede, and all other thinges reuealed by God. The Proteſtants auerre it to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faith, whereby they apply to themſelues the promiſes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and of life euerlaſting by Chriſt. This to be the true juſtifying faith, M. PERKINS ſaith he hath proued already: he ſhoulde haue donne well, to haue noted the place, for I knowe not where to ſeeke it: but he will here adde a reaſon or twaine.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Reaſon. <hi>The faith whereby we liue, is the faith whereby we are iuſtified: but the faith whereby we liue, is a particular faith, whereby we apply Chriſt to our ſelues,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                           <hi>I liue,</hi> that is ſpiritually, <hi>by the faith of the ſonne of God: which faith he ſheweth to be a particular faith in Chriſt, in the wordes following: Who hath loued me, and giuen himſelfe for me particularly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> I admitte, and deny the <hi>Minor:</hi> and ſay that the proofe is not to purpoſe. For in the <hi>Minor</hi> he ſpeaketh of faith, wherby we apply Chriſts merits vnto our ſelues, making them ours, in the proof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith only, that Chriſt died for him in particular. He makes no mention of his apprehending of Chriſts iuſtice, and making of it his owne, which are very diſtinct thinges. All Catholikes beleeue with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Chriſt died, as for all men in generall: ſo for euery man in particular, yea and that his loue was ſo exceeding great, towardes mankinde, that he would willingly haue beſtowed his life, for the redemption of one only man. But hereupon it doth not followe, that euery man may lay handes vpon Chriſts righteouſnes, and apply it to himſelfe (or elſe Turkes, Iewes, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and euill Catholikes, might make very bolde with him) but muſt firſt doe thoſe thinges which he requires at their handes, to be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his ineſtimable merits: as to repent them hartely of their ſins, to beleue and hope in him, to be baptized, and to haue a full purpoſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all his commaundements. Which M. PER. alſo confeſſeth that all men haue not only promiſed,<note place="margin">Pag. 152.</note> but alſo vowed in Baptiſme. Now becauſe we are not aſſured that we ſhall performe all this, therefore we may not ſo preſumptuouſly apply vnto our ſelues, Chriſts righteouſnes, &amp; life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, although we beleeue that he died for euery one of vs in particular. That which followeth, M. PER. hath no colour of probability: that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this manner of beleefe, that is, in applying to himſelfe Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21661:39"/> was an example vnto all that are ſaued.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1 16 Phil. 3.15.</note> See the places good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and learne to beware the bolde vnskilfulneſſe of ſectaries.

                        <p>M. PERKINS 2. Reaſon. <hi>That which we muſt aske of God in prayer, that we muſt beleeue ſhall be giuen vs: but in prayer me muſt aske the merits of Chriſtes righteouſneſſe to our ſelues.</hi> ergo.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Of the <hi>Maior</hi> much hath beene ſaid before, here I admitte it, all due circumſtances of prayer being obſerued, &amp; deny that we muſt pray, that our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus merits may be made ours in particular, for that were greatly to abaſe them: but good Chriſtians pray, that through the infinite value of thoſe his merits, our ſinnes may be forgiuen, &amp; a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice proportionable vnto our capacity, may be powred into our ſoules, whereby we may leade a vertuous life, and make a bleſſed end. But it is goodly to beholde, how M. PERKINS proueth that me muſt pray, that Chriſts righteouſnes may be made our particular juſtice, becauſe ſaith he, <hi>We are taught in the</hi> Pater noſter, <hi>to pray in this manner:</hi> forgiue vs our debts, <hi>and to this we muſt ſay</hi> Amen, <hi>which is as much to ſay as our petition is graunted.</hi> I thinke the poore mans wits were gonne a pilgrimage, when he wrote thus. Good Sir, cannot our ſinnes or debts be forgiuen, without we apply Chriſts righteouſnes to vs in particular? we ſay yes. Doe not then ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply begge that which is in queſtion, nor take that for giuen, which will neuer be graunted. But a word with you by the way. Your righteous man muſt ouer-skippe that petition of the <hi>Pater noſter (forgiue vs our debts)</hi> for he is well aſſured, that his debts be already pardoned. For at the very firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that he had faith, he had Chriſts righteouſnes applyed to him, and thereby aſſurance both of the pardon of ſinnes, and of life euerlaſting. Wherefore he can not without infidelity, diſtruſt of his former juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or pray for remiſſion of his debts: but following the famous example of that formall Phariſe, in liew of demaunding pardon, may wel ſay.<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>O God I giue thee thankes that I am not as the reſt of men, extortioners, vniuſt, aduouterers, as alſo theſe Papiſts:</hi> Fearing the remiſſion of my ſinnes, or the certayntie of my ſaluation, but am well aſſured thereof, and of Chriſts owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes too, and ſo forth. But to goe on with M. PERKINS diſcourſe. <hi>Here we muſt note, that the Church of Rome cutteth off one principall dutie of faith, for in faith</hi> (ſaith M. PERKINS) <hi>are two thinges: firſt, knowledge reuealed in the word, touching the meanes of ſaluation: Secondly, an applying of thinges, knowne vnto our ſelues, which ſome call affiance: the firſt they acknowledge.</hi> So then by M. PERKINS owne confeſſion, Catholikes haue true knowledge of the meanes of ſaluation; (then he and his fellowes erre miſerable.) <hi>The ſecond which is the ſubſtance and principall they denie.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Catholikes teach men alſo to haue a firme hope, and a great confidence of obtayning ſaluation, through the mercy of God, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſts Paſsion. So they performe their dutie towardes God, and their neighbour, or elſe die with true repentance. But for a man at his firſt conuerſion, to aſſure himſelfe by faith of Chriſts righteouſnes, and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting; without condition of doing thoſe thinges, he ought to doe, that we Catholikes affirme to be, not any gift of faith, but the haynous crime of preſumption, which is a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,<note place="margin">See S.

                           <hi>I demaund nowe, doeſt thou beleeue in Chriſt, O ſinner? thou ſaieſt I beleeue: what beleeueſt thou that all thy ſinnes may freely be pardoned by him, thou haſt that which thou beleeueſt.</hi> See, here is neither applying of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes vnto vs by faith, nor ſo much as beleeuing our ſinnes to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned through him, but that they may be pardoned by him. So there is not one word for M. PERKINS. But S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith playnlie: <hi>That we muſt beleeue that our ſinnes are pardoned vs.</hi> But he addeth not by the imputed righteouſnes of Chriſt. Againe, he addeth conditions on our party, which M. PERK. craftely concealeth. For S. <hi>Bernard</hi> graunteth that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue our ſins to be forgiuen, if the truth of our conuerſion meete with the mercy of God preuenting vs, for in the ſame place he hath theſe wordes: <hi>So therefore ſhall his mercy dwell in our earth,</hi> that is, <hi>the grace of God in our ſoules, if mercy and truth meete together, if iuſtice and peace, embrace and kiſſe each other.</hi> Which is as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> there expoundeth it, if we ſtirred vp by the grace of God, doe truly bewaile our ſinnes and confeſſe them, and afterward follow holines of life and peace. All which M. PERKINS did wiſely cut off, becauſe it daſhed cleane the vayne gloſſe of the former wordes.</p>
                        <p>His laſt authority is out of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who exhorteth men, paſſing out of this life, not to doubt of God promiſes, but to beleeue that we ſhall come to Chriſt with joyfull ſecurity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> encouradgeth good Chriſtians dying, to haue a full confidence in the promiſes of Chriſt, and ſo doe all Catholikes, and bidde them be ſecure too on that ſide, that Chriſt will neuer faile of his word and promiſe, but ſay that the cauſe of feare lyes on our owne infirmities: And yet biddes them not to doubt, as though they were as likely to be condemned as ſaued, but animates them, and puts them in the good way of hope, by twenty kindes of reaſon.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS hauing thus confirmed his owne partie, why doth he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21661:40"/> not after his manner confute thoſe reaſons, which the Catholikes alleadge in fauour of their aſſertion? Was it becauſe they are not wont to produce any in this matter? Nothing leſſe: It was then belike, becauſe he knew not how to anſwere them. I will out of their ſtoare take that one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall one, of the teſtimony of holy Scripture, And by that alone ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue, that the faith required to juſtification, is that Catholike faith, whereby we beleeue all that to be true, which by God is reuealed, and not any other particular beleeuing Chriſts righteouſnes to be ours. How can this be better knowne then if we ſee, weigh, and conſider well, what kinde of faith that was which all they had, who are ſaid in Scriptures to be iuſtified by their faith.</p>
                        <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Noe, That he was inſtituted heire of the iuſtice,</hi> which is, by faith.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> What faith had he?

                           <hi>I make knowne vnto you the Gospell, which I haue preached, and by which you ſhall be ſaued, vnleſſe perhaps you haue beleeued in vayne.</hi> What was that Goſpell? <hi>I haue deliuered vnto you that which I haue receiued, that Chriſt died for our ſinnes, according to the Scriptures, was buried, and roſe againe the third day, &amp;c.</hi> So by the verdite of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the beleefe of the articles of the creede, is that juſtifying faith, by which you muſt be ſaued. And neither in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any other place of Holy Scriptures is it once taught, that a particular faith whereby we applie, Chriſts righteouſnes to our ſelues, &amp; aſſure our ſelues of our ſaluation, is either a juſtifying, or any Chriſtian mans faith, but the very naturall act, of that ougly Monſter preſumption: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing layd as the very corner ſtone of the Proteſtants irreligion, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and modeſt conuerſation, what humility and deuotion can they build vpon it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond difference in the manner of juſtification, is about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall act of faith, which M. PERKINS handleth as it were by the way, cuttedly I will be as ſhorte as he, the matter not being great. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes teach as you haue heard out of the Councell of Trent, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this queſtion, that many actes of faith, feare, hope, and charity doe goe before our juſtification, preparing our ſoule to receiue into it from God, through Chriſt that great grace.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS Doctor like reſolueth otherwiſe, <hi>That faith is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, created by God in the hart of man, at his conuerſion, whereby he apprehendeth and receiueth Chriſts righteouſnes, for his iuſtification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This joylie deſcription is ſet downe without any other probation, then his owne authority that deliuered it: and ſo, let it paſſe as already ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted. And if there needed any other diſproofe of it, I might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one more out of this owne explication of it, where he ſaith that the couenant of grace is communicated vnto vs, by the word of God, and by the Sacraments. For if faith created in our hartes, be the only ſufficient ſupernaturall inſtrument, to apprehend that couenant of grace, then there needes no Sacraments for that purpoſe, and conſequently I would fayne know by the way, how litle infants, that can not for want of judgement, and diſcretion haue any ſuch act of faith, as to lay hold on Chriſt his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, are juſtified? Muſt we without any warrant in Gods word, contrary to all experience, beleeue that they haue this act of faith, before the come to any vnderſtanding.</p>
                        <p>But to returne vnto the ſound doctrine of our Catholike faith, M. PER. findes two faults with it, one that we teach faith to goe before juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas by the word of God (ſaith he) at the very inſtant, when any man beleeueth firſt, he is then both, juſtified and ſanctified. What word
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21661:41"/> of God ſo teacheth? Marry this. <hi>He that beleeueth, eateth and drinketh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chriſt, and is already paſſed from death to life.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Io. 6.54.</note> I anſwere that our Sauiour in that text ſpeaketh not of beleeuing, but of eating his body in the bleſſed Sacrament, which who ſo receiueth worthely, obtayneth thereby life euerlaſting, as Chriſt ſaith expreſſely in that place. And ſo this proofe is vayne.</p>
                        <p>Now will I proue out of the holy Scriptures, that faith goeth before juſtification, firſt by that of S. <hi>Paul. Whoſoeuer calleth on the name of our Lord,</hi>

                        <p>In like manner Queene <hi>Candaces Eunuch,</hi> hauing heard S. <hi>Philippe,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing vnto him Chriſt, beleeued that IESVS CHRIST was the Sonne of God (no talke in thoſe dayes of applying vnto himſelfe Chriſts righteouſnes,) yet was he not juſtified, before deſcending out of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot he was baptized.<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> And three dayes paſſed betweene S. <hi>Paules</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and his juſtification, as doth euidently appeare by the hiſtorie of his conuerſion.<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond fault he findeth with our faith, is that we take it to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but an illumination of the minde, ſtirring vp the will, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo moued and helped by grace, cauſeth in the hart many good ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motions.

Not ſo good Sir, but that men ſpiritually dead, being quickned by Gods ſpirit, may haue many good motions, for as our ſpirit giueth life vnto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſo the ſpirit of God by his grace animateth, and giueth life vnto our ſoules.

The Papiſts ſay, that man is iuſtified by faith, yet not by faith alone, but alſo by other vertues, as the feare of God, hope, loue, &amp;c. The reaſons which are brought to maintayne their opinion, are of no moment: well let vs heare ſome of them, that the indifferent Reader may iudge whether they be of any moment or no. <hi>M. PERKINS firſt Reaſon.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 7.47.</note>MANY <hi>ſinnes are forgiuen her, becauſe ſhe hath loued much: whence they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the woman there ſpoken of, had pardon of her ſinnes, and was iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by loue.</hi> Anſwere. <hi>In this text, loue is not made an impulſiue cauſe, to moue God to pardon her ſinnes, but only a ſigne, to ſhew that God had already pardoned them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> Obſerue firſt, that Catholikes doe not teach, that ſhe was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for loue alone, for they vſe not (as Proteſtants doe) when they finde one cauſe of juſtification, to exclude all, or any of the reſt: But conſidering that in ſundry places of holy write, juſtification is aſcribed vnto many ſeuerall vertues, affirme that not faith alone, but diuers other diuine qualities concurre vnto juſtification, and as mention here made of loue, excludeth not faith, hope, repentance, and ſuch like: ſo in other places, where faith is only ſpoken of, there hope, charity, and the reſt, muſt not alſo be excluded. This ſinner had aſſured beleefe in Chriſtes power to remitte ſinnes, and great hope in his mercy that he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, great ſorrowe and deteſtation of her ſinne alſo ſhe had, that in ſuch an aſſembly did ſo humbly proſtrate her ſelfe at Chriſtes feete, to waſh them with her teares, and to wipe them with the haires of her head. And as ſhee had true repentance of her former life, ſo no doubt but ſhee had alſo a firme purpoſe, to leade a newe life. So that in her conuerſion, all thoſe vertues mette together, which we holde to concurre to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and among the reſt, the preheminence worthely is giuen to loue, as to the principall diſpoſition. She loued our Sauiour as the fountayne of all mercies, and goodnes, and therefore accounted her pretious oynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſt beſtowed on him; yea, and the humbleſt ſeruice, and moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate ſhe could offer him, to be all too little, and nothing anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the inward burning charity which ſhe bare him. Which noble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of hers, towardes her diuine Redeemer, no queſtion, was moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto him, as by his owne word is moſt manifeſt: for he ſaid, <hi>That many ſinnes were forgiuen her, becauſe ſhe loued much.</hi> But M. PERKINS ſaith, that her loue was no cauſe that moued Chriſt to pardon her, but only a ſigne of pardon giuen before: which is ſo contrary to the text, that a man not paſt all ſhame, would bluſh once to affirme it. Firſt Chriſt ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſlie, that it was the cauſe of the pardon: <hi>Becauſe ſhee had loued much.</hi>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:21661:42"/> Secondly, that her loue went before, is as playnlie declared, both by men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time paſt: <hi>Becauſe ſhe hath loued,</hi> and by the euidence of her fact of waſhing, wiping, and anoynting his feete: for the which ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, then already performed: <hi>Manie ſinnes are forgiuen her.</hi> So that here can be no impediment of beleeuing the Catholike Doctrine, ſo clearly deliuered by the holy Ghoſt, vnleſſe one will be ſo blindly ledde by our new Maſters, that he will beleeue no wordes of Chriſt, be they neuer ſo playne, otherwiſe then it pleaſe the Miniſters to expound them. And this much of the firſt of thoſe reaſons, which M. PERKINS ſaid were of no moment.</p>

                           <hi>but faith that worketh by charity. Hence Catholikes gather, that when the Apoſtle attributeth iuſtification to ſaith, he meanes not faith alone, but as it is ioyned with charity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vertues, as are requiſite to prepare the ſoule of man, to receiue that complete grace of iuſtification.</hi> M. PERKINS anſwereth that they are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>But it is faith alone that apprehendeth Chriſts righteouſnes, and maketh it ours. It vſeth charity as an inſtrument to performe the duties of the firſt and ſecond table, but it hath no part with faith in the matter of our iuſtification.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> That it hath the chiefeſt part, and that faith is rather the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and hand mayd of charity. My proofe ſhall be out of the very text alleadged, where life and motion is giuen to faith by charity, as the greeke word <hi>Energoumene</hi> being paſſiue, doth playnlie ſhewe, that faith is moued, led, and guided by charity. Which S. <hi>Iames</hi> doth demonſtrat moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, ſaying that. <hi>Euen as the body is dead without the ſoule, ſo is faith without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> Making charity to be the life, and as it were the ſoule of faith: Now no man is ignorant, but it is the ſoule that vſeth the body, as an inſtrument, euen ſo then it is charity, that vſeth faith as her inſtrument and inferiour, and not contrarywiſe: which S. <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth at large in a whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, prouing charity to be a more excellent gift then faith, or any other, concluding with theſe wordes. <hi>Now there remayneth faith, hope, and charity,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>theſe three, but the greater of theſe is charity?</hi> Whereupon S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reſolueth thus. <hi>Nothing but charity maketh faith it ſelfe auaylable,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Li. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. cap. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>for faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may be without charity, but it can not be auaylable without it:</hi> So that firſt you ſee that charity is the mouer, and commaunder, and faith, as her inſtrument, and hand mayde.</p>
                        <p>Now that in the worke of juſtification, it hath the chiefe place, may be thus proued, I demaund whether that worke of juſtification by faith be done, for the loue of God, and to his honour or no? If not, as it is voyd of charity, ſo it is a wicked and ſinnefull act, no juſtification, but infection, our owne intereſt being the principall end of it: now if it comprehend &amp; conclude Gods glory, and ſeruice in it, that is, if they apply Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21661:43"/> to them, to glorifie God thereby, then hath charity the principall part therein: for the directing of all, to the honour and glory of God, is the proper office and action of charity. All this reaſon that charity both concurreth to juſtification, and that as principall, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confirmeth in theſe wordes:<note place="margin">Serm. 22. de verbis Apoſtol.</note> 
                           <hi>The houſe of God,</hi> (that is, a righteous and Godly ſoule,) <hi>hath for his foundation faith, hope is the walles of it; but charity is the roofe and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third of theſe trifling reaſons, is peruerſly propounded by M. PER. thus. <hi>Faith is neuer alone, therefore it doth not iuſtifie alone:</hi> That this argument is fondly framed, appeereth playnlie in that, that Catholikes doe not deny, but affirme that faith may be without charity, as it is in all ſinnefull Catholikes, we then forme the reaſon thus. If faith alone be the whole cauſe of juſtification, then if both, hope and charity were remoued from faith (at leaſt by thought, and in conceipt,) faith would neuertheleſſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. But faith conſidered without hope, &amp; charity will not juſtifie: <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not the whole cauſe of juſtification. The firſt propoſition can not be denyed of them, who knowe the nature and proprietie of cauſes, for the entire and total cauſe of any thing, being (as the Philoſophers ſay) in act, the effect muſt needes followe, and very ſence teacheth the ſimple, that if any thing be ſet to worke, and if it doe not act that which it is ſet too, then there wanted ſome thing requiſite. And conſequently that was not the whole cauſe of that worke.</p>
                        <p>Now to the ſecond propoſition. <hi>But their imagined faith can not apply to themſelues, Chriſts righteouſnes without the preſence of hope and charity.</hi> For elſe he might be juſtified without any hope of heauen, and without any loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God, and eſtimation of his honour, which are thinges moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in themſelues: but yet very well fitting the Proteſtants juſtification, which is nothing elſe but the playne vice of preſumption, as hath beene before declared: Yet to auoid this inconuenience which is ſo great, M. PE. graunteth that both, hope and charity muſt needes be preſent at the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but doe nothing in it, but faith doth all, as the head is preſent to the eie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſeeth, yet it is the eie alone that ſeeth. Here is a worthy peece of Philoſophy, that the eie alone doth ſee, whereas in truth it is but the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeing, the ſoule being the principall cauſe of ſight, as it is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions, of life, ſence, and reaſon: and it is not to purpoſe here, where we require the preſence of the whole cauſe, &amp; not only of the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe. And to returne your ſimilitude vpon your ſelfe, as the eie cannot ſee without the head, becauſe it receiueth influence from it, before it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee, ſo cannot faith juſtifie without charity, becauſe it neceſſarily receiueth ſpirit of life from it, before it can doe any thing acceptable in Gods ſight.</p>
                        <p>The fourth reaſon, if faith alone doe juſtifie, then faith alone will ſaue,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21661:43"/> but it will not ſaue, <hi>ergo.</hi> M. PERKINS firſt denyeth the propoſition, and ſaith. <hi>That it may iuſtifie, and yet not ſaue: becauſe more is required to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then to iuſtification.</hi> Which is falſe, for put the caſe that an Innocent babe dye ſhortly after his baptiſme wherein he was juſtified, ſhall he not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for want of any thing? I hope you will ſay yes: euen ſo any man that is juſtified, if he depart in that ſtate, no man makes doubt of his ſaluation, therefore this firſt ſhift was very friuoulous. Which M. PERKINS per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing flies to a ſecond, that for faith alone we ſhall alſo be ſaued, &amp; that good workes ſhall not be regarded at the day of our judgement. Then muſt thoſe wordes of the holy Ghoſt ſo often repeted in the Scriptures be razed out of the text. <hi>God at that time will render vnto euery man, according to his workes.</hi> But of this more amply in the queſtion of merits.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Reaſon. There be many other vertues, vnto which juſtification and ſaluation are aſcribed in Gods word: therefore faith alone ſufficeth not. The Antecedent is proued, firſt of feare it is ſaid. <hi>He that is without feare,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſ. 1. Rom. 8. Luc. 13. 1. Ioan. 3.</note>

                        <p>Now the doctrine which M. PERKINS teacheth, is cleane contrary. For (ſaith he) <hi>A ſinner is iuſtified by faith alone,</hi> that is, nothing that man can doe by nature or grace, concurreth thereto as any kind of cauſe, but faith a lone. Farther he ſaith, <hi>That faith it ſelfe is no principall, but rather an inſtrumentall cauſe, whereby we apprehend and apply Chriſt and his righteouſnes for our iuſtification.</hi> So that in fine, we haue that faith ſo much by them magnified, and called the only and whole cauſe of our juſtification, is in the end become no true cauſe at all, but a bare condition, without which we cannot be juſtified. If it be an inſtrumentall cauſe,<note place="margin">Conditio ſine qua non.</note> let him then declare what is the principall cauſe, whoſe inſtrument faith is? and chooſe whether he had leifer to haue charity, or the ſoule of man without any helpe of grace.</p>
                        <p>But to come to his reaſons. The firſt is taken out of theſe wordes. <hi>As</hi> Moyſes <hi>lift vp the ſerpent in the deſart,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note>

Marry M. PERKINS drawes it in after this faſhion. As nothing was required of them who were ſtrong by ſerpents, but that they ſhould looke vpon the braſen ſerpent: So nothing is required of a ſinner, to deliuer him from ſinne, but that he caſt his eye of faith vpon Chriſts righteouſnes, and apply that to himſelfe in particular. But this application of the ſimilitude is only mans fooliſh inuention without any ground in the text. Similttudes be not in all poynts alike, neither muſt be ſtreatched beyond the very poynt wherein the ſimilitude lyeth, which in this matter is, that like as the Iſraelites in the Wildernes ſtoung with ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, were cured by looking vpon the braſen ſerpent: ſo men infected with ſin, haue no other remedy, then to embrace the faith of Chriſt Ieſus: All this we confeſſe, but to ſay that nothing elſe is neceſſary, that is quite beſides the text, and as eaſely rejected by vs, as it is by him obtruded without any authority, or probability.</p>
                        <p>His 2. reaſon is collected of excluſiue ſpeeches (as he ſpeaketh) vſed in Scriptures.<note place="margin">Gal 2.16.</note> 
                           <hi>As we are iuſtified freely, not of the lawe, not by the lawe not of workes,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21661:44"/> not of our ſelues, not of the workes of the lawe, but by faith: all boaſting excluded:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 8.50:</note> 
                           <hi>only beleeue.</hi> Theſe diſtinctions whereby works &amp; the law are excluded in the worke of juſtification, include thus much, that faith alone doth juſtifie.</p>
                        <p>It doth not ſo: for theſe excluſiue ſpeeches do not exclude feare, hope and charity, more then they exclude faith it ſelfe. Which may be called a worke of the lawe, aſwell as any other vertue, being as much required by the lawe as any other. But S. <hi>Paules</hi> meaning in thoſe places is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all ſuch workes, as either Iewe or Gentile did, or could bragge of, as donne of themſelues, and ſo thought that by them, they deſerued to be made Chriſtians. For he truly ſaith, that all were concluded in ſinne, and needed the grace of God, which they were to receiue of his free mercy, through the merits of Chriſt, and not of any deſart of their owne: And that to obtayne this grace through Chriſt, it was not needefull, nay rather hurtfull to obſerue the ceremonies of <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe, as Circumciſion, the obſeruation of any of their feaſtes, or faſtes, nor any ſuch like worke of the lawe, which the Iewes reputed ſo neceſſary. Againe, that all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall workes of the Gentiles could not deſerue this grace, which workes not proceeding from charity, were nothing worth in Gods ſight. And ſo all workes, both of Iewe and Gentile, are excluded from being any meritorious cauſe of juſtification, and conſequently, all their boaſting of their owne forces, their firſt juſtification being freely beſtowed vpon them. Yet all this notwithſtanding, a certaine vertuous diſpoſition is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Iewe and Gentile, whereby his ſoule is prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that great grace of juſtification: that ſay we, is faith, feare, hope, loue, and repentance, that (ſay the Proteſtants) is faith only. Wherefore ſay we as the excluding of workes, and boaſting exclude not faith, no more doe they exclude the reſt, faith being as well our worke, and a worke of the lawe as any of the reſt, and all the reſt being of grace, as well as faith, and as farre from boaſting of, as faith it ſelfe. Now that out of S <hi>Luke, beleeue only,</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe. For he was bid beleeue the rayſing of his daughter to life, and not that Chriſts righteouſnes was his: and faith alone may be a ſufficient diſpoſition to obtayne a myracle, but not to obtayne juſtification, of which the queſtion only is.</p>

                        <p>MASTER PERKINS third Argument. <hi>Very reaſon may teach vs thus much: that no gift in man is apt as a ſpirituall hand to receiue and apply Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe vnto a ſinner, ſauing faith, loue, hope, feare, repentance, haue their ſeuerall vſes, but none of them ſerue for this ende of apprehending, but faith only.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Amſwere.</hi> Mans reaſon is but a blinde miſtris in matters of faith, and he that hath no better an inſtructor in ſuch high miſteries, muſt needs know little. But what if that alſo faile you in this poynt? then euery man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſee how naked you are of all kinde of probability. I ſay then, that reaſon rather teacheth the contrary. For in common ſence, no man apprehendeth and entreth into the poſſeſsion of any thing, by beleeuing that he hath it. For if a man ſhoulde beleeue that he is rich, of honour, wiſe, or vertuous: Doth he thereby become preſently ſuch a one? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe. His faith and perſwaſion is no fitte inſtrument to apply and drawe theſe thinges to himſelfe, as all the worlde ſees. How then doth reaſon teach me, that by beleeuing Chriſtes righteouſneſſe to bee mine owne, I lay hand on it, and make it mine. Againe Chriſts righteouſnes (according to their owne opinion) is not receiued into vs at all, but is ours only by Gods imputation, what neede we then faith, as a ſpirituall hand to receiue it? If they ſay (as M. PERKINS doth) that faith is as it were a condition required in vs, which when God ſeeth in vs, he preſently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth Chriſts righteouſneſſe to vs, and maketh it ours. Then will I be bolde to ſay, that any other vertue is as proper as faith, to haue Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto vs: there being no other aptneſſe requiſite in the condition it ſelfe, but only the will and ordinance of God: then euery thing that it ſhal pleaſe him to appoynt, is alike apt: and ſo M. PERKINS had ſmall reaſon to ſay, that faith was the only apt inſtrument to apply to vs Chriſts righteouſneſſe.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, true diuine reaſon teacheth me, that both hope and charity, doe much more apply vnto Chriſtians all Chriſtes merits, and make them doe then faith: For what faith aſſureth me of in generall, that hope
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21661:45"/> applyeth vnto me in particular: by faith I beleeue CHRIST to be the Sauiour of all mankind: by hope I truſt to be made partaker of that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in him. But charity doth yet giue me a greater confidence of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: for by the rule of true charity, as I dedicate and imploy my life, labours, and all that I haue to the ſeruice of God, ſo all that God hath is made mine, ſo farre forth as it can be made mine: according vnto that ſacred lawe of friendſhippe: <hi>Amicorum omnia ſunt communia.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in true reaſon, neither by faith, nor any other vertue, we take ſuch holde on Chriſts merittes, nor haue ſuch intereſt in his ineſtimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as by charity: which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vnderſtoode well, when he made it the modell, and meaſure of juſtification: ſaying, <hi>That Charity beginning,</hi>

                        <head>THE THIRD DIFFERENCE ABOVT IVSTIFICATION, howe farre forth good workes are required thereto.</head>
                        <p>MASTER PERKINS ſaith,<note place="margin">Pag. 91.</note> 
                           <hi>That after the doctrine of the Church of Rome there be two kindes of iuſtification: the firſt, when of a ſinner one is made iuſt: the which is of the meere mercy of God, through Chriſt, without any merit of man, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome certayne good deuotions of the ſoule, (as the actes of Faith, Feare, Hope, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Repentance) goe before, to prepare as it were the way, and to make it more ſit to receiue that high grace of iuſtification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond iuſtification is, when a iuſt man by the exerciſe of vertues, is made more iuſt: as a Childe newe borne, doth by nuriture growe, day by day bigger: of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace, Catholikes hold good workes to be the meritorious cauſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS firſt graunteth, that good workes doe pleaſe God, and haue a temporall reward.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That they are neceſſary to ſaluation, not as the cauſe thereof, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as markes in away to direct vs towardes ſaluation: or as fruites and ſignes of righteouſnes, to declare one to be juſt before men: all which he ſhuffleth in, rather to delude our arguments, then for that they eſteeme much of good workes, which they hold to be no better then deadly ſins.</p>
                        <p>The maine difference then betweene vs, conſiſteth in this, whether good workes be the true cauſe indeede, of the increaſe of our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which we call the ſecond juſtification, or whether they be only fruits, ſignes, or markes of it.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS pretendes to proue, that they are no cauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our juſtice: and yet frames not one argument directly to that purpoſe: but repeates thoſe objections, and propoſeth them now at large, which he made before, againſt the firſt juſtification: the which although impertinent to this place, yet I will ſolue them firſt, and then ſet downe our owne.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>We conclude that a man is iuſtified by faith, without the workes of the lawe.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Rom. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The Apoſtle there ſpeaketh of the juſtification of a ſinner: for he ſaith before, that he hath proued, both Iewe, and Greeke, to be vnder
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21661:47"/> ſinne; and that all haue ſinned, and neede the glory of God: Wherefore this place appertaynes not vnto the ſecond juſtification: and excludes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either workes of the law, as not neceſſary vnto the firſt juſtification of a ſinner: againſt the Iewes who thought and taught them to be neceſſary: or elſe againſt the Gentils any worke of ours, from being any meritorious cauſe of that firſt juſtification: for we acknowledge very willingly (as you haue heard often before) that euery ſinner is juſtified freely of the meere grace of God, through the merit of Chriſt onely, and without any merit of the ſinner himſelfe: and yet is not a ſinner (being of yeares of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) meerely paſſiue in that his juſtification, as M. PERKINS very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly ſaith: for in their owne opinion he muſt beleeue (which is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:) and in ours not onely beleeue but alſo, Hope, Loue, &amp; Repente: And this kinde of juſtification excludeth all boaſting in our ſoules, as wel as theirs. For as they muſt graunt, that they may not bragge of their faith, although it be an act of theirs ſo neceſſarily required at their juſtification, that without it, they could not be juſtified: euen ſo let them thinke of the reſt of thoſe good preparations, which we hold to be neceſſary, that we cannot truly boaſt of them, as though they came of our ſelues, but we confeſſe all theſe good inſpirations, as all other good, to deſcend from the bounteous liberality of the father of lightes: and for the yeelding of our conſent to them; we can no more vaunt, then of conſenting vnto faith, all which is no more then if a man be mired in a lake, and vnable of himſelfe to get out, would be content that an other of his goodneſſe ſhould helpe him out of it. Yet obſerue by the way: that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth not all glorying or boaſting:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>For he gloryeth in the hope of glory of the Sonne of</hi> GOD,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>and in his tribulations:</hi> Againe. <hi>He defineth that we may glory in meaſure, and that he might glory in his power. And that he was conſtayned to glory in his viſions and reuelations:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> So that a good Chriſtian may glory in our Lord, and in his heauenly giftes, ſo it be in meaſure, and due ſeaſon. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them from whence they come. But to boaſt and ſay that eyther GOD needed vs, or that our good partes were cauſe, that GOD called vs firſt to his ſeruice, is both falſe, and vtterly vnlawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.</note>
                           <hi>So that by grace yea are ſaued through faith, and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God: not of workes leaſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.</hi> Is nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Doctrine of juſtification, but too too ignorantly or maliciouſly cited againſt it: and note alſo with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that faith is there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,<note place="margin">Lib. 83. q. 76.</note> to exclude all merites of our workes, which went before and might ſeeme to the ſimple to haue beene ſome cauſe why God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his firſt grace vpon vs: but no vertuous diſpoſitions requiſite for the better preparation to the ſame grace: and therefore very fondly doth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21661:47"/> M. PERKINS inferre, that in that ſentence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of workes of grace: becauſe in the text following hee mentioned good workes. Whereas the Apoſtle putteth an euident diſtinction betweene thoſe two kinde of workes, ſignifying the firſt: <hi>To be of ourſelues.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>To proceede from vs as Gods workemanſhippe, created in</hi> CHRIST IESVS, and the firſt, he calleth <hi>Workes</hi> ſimply: the ſecond, <hi>Good workes, prepared of God for vs to walke in after our first iuſtification.</hi> What groſſe ignorance then was it, to take theſe two ſo diſtinct manner of workes, for the ſame, and to ground himſelfe ſo boldly vpon it.</p>
                        <p>Now to his ſecond reaſon. <hi>If you be circumciſed,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gal. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>you are bound to the whole lawe.</hi> Hence thus he argueth: <hi>If a man will be iuſtified by workes, he is bound to fulfill the whole lawe, according to the rigour of it.</hi> That is <hi>Paules</hi> ground: <hi>But no man can fulfill the lawe, according vnto the rigour of it:</hi> ergo. <hi>No man can be iuſtified by workes.</hi> He can apply the text prefixed vnto any part of the argument. <hi>Erit mihi magnus Appollo:</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> only ſaith in theſe wordes: <hi>That if you bee circumciſed, yea are bound to keepe the whole lawe of</hi> Moyſes. M. PERKINS, <hi>That if a man will be iustified by workes, he muſt fulfill the rigour of the lawe:</hi> Which are as juſt as <hi>Germains</hi> lippes, as they ſay: But M. PERKINS ſayes that it is Saint <hi>Paules</hi> ground: but he is much deceiued, for the Apoſtles ground is this. That circumciſion is as it were a profeſſion of Iudaiſme, and therefore he that would be circumcided, did make himſelfe ſubject vnto the whole lawe of the Iewes. Of the poſſibilities of fulfilling the lawe, becauſe M. PERKINS toucheth ſo often that ſtring, ſhall be treated in a diſtinct queſtion, as ſoone as I haue diſpatched this.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS third Argument. <hi>Election to ſaluation is of grace without workes: wherefore the iuſtification of a ſinner is of grace alone without workes: becauſe election is the cauſe of iuſtification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> That election is of grace without workes, done of our owne ſimple forces, or without the workes of <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe: but not without prouiſion of good workes iſſuing out of faith, and the helpe of Gods grace, as ſhall be handled more largely in the queſtion of merits.</p>

                        <head>OF THE SECOND IVSTIFICATION.</head>
                        <p>THE fourth argument. <hi>A man iuſt be fully iuſtified, before he can doe a good worke: and therefore good workes can not goe before iustification.</hi> True, not before the firſt juſtification of a ſinner. But good Sir, you hauing made in the beginning of this laſt Article a diſtinction betweene the firſt and ſecond juſtification: And hauing before diſcuſſed the firſt,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21661:48"/> and the ſecond now remayning, and expecting you, why did you not ſay one word of it, the matter being ample and well worthy the handling? albeit you will not willingly confeſſe any ſecond juſtification as you ſay: Yet had it beene your part at leaſt to haue diſproued ſuch arguments, as we bring to proue a ſecond juſtification: Yee acknowledge that there be degrees of ſanctification: But theſe degrees muſt be made downeward of euill, worſer and worſt: for if all our ſanctification and beſt workes be like vnto defiled cloutes, and no better then deadly ſinnes as you hold, and elſe where,<note place="margin">Pag. 76.</note> let any wiſe man judge what degrees of goodnes can be lodged in it. Againe, how abſurd is that poſition, that there is but one ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, whereby they take faſt hold on Chriſts righteouſnes, which can neuer after, be either looſed or increaſed. Why then doe you with your brother <hi>Iouinian,</hi> maintayne, that all men are equally righteous? If it ſo be:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. con Iouin. Epiſt 81. Epiſt 57.

                        <p>Firſt that of the reuelations. <hi>Let him that is iuſt be yet iuſtified:</hi> or as your text hath it.<note place="margin">Cap. 22.</note> 
                           <hi>He that is righteous, let him be more righteous:</hi> and that of, <hi>feare not to be iuſtified euen vntill death:</hi>

Which is confirmed, where it is ſaid: <hi>That the path of a iust man proceedeth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prob. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>as the light doth vntill it be perfect day;</hi> Which is degrees more &amp; more: And S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth the ſame, where he ſaith to men that giue almes plentifully.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>That God will multiply their ſeede, and augment the increaſes of the fruits of their iuſtice.</hi> Further, S. <hi>Iames</hi> doth moſt effectually proue this increaſe of righteouſnes, and the ſecond iuſtification, in theſe wordes. Abraham <hi>our father was he not iuſtified by workes, offering</hi> Iſaac <hi>his Sonne vpon the Aultar.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> That he ſpeaketh of the ſecond iuſtification is euident: for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was iuſtified before <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne, as it is moſt manifeſt by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelfe: and by that heroicall act, of not ſparing his onely &amp; entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued Sonne,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 15. Rom. 4.</note> his iuſtice was much augmented. And the Apoſtle himſelfe ſeemeth to haue forſeene all our aduerſaries cauillation, and to haue ſo longe before preuented them: Firſt, that common ſhift of theirs (that this worke was a ſigne, or the fruit onely of his faith, and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of it, in the matter of iuſtification) is formally confuted: for the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking diſtinctly of both, his faith, and worke, and joyning them both in this act of juſtification, attributeth the better part of it, vnto his worke: thus; <hi>Seeſt thou that faith did worke with his workes, and by the workes the faith was conſummate and made perfect.</hi> Which he doth after fitly declare by a ſimilitude, comparing faith to the body, and good workes to the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21661:48"/> ſoule: which giue life and luſtre to faith, otherwiſe faith is of litle value &amp; eſtimation with God. Which S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo teacheth at large, among other ſpeeches including this: <hi>That if he ſhould haue all faith, and wanted charity,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13</note> 
                           <hi>he were nothing:</hi> And comparing faith &amp; charity together, defineth expreſly, that charity is the greater vertue: Which charity is the fountayne of all good workes. And ſo by this preferring theſe workes of charity, before faith, he doth ſtop the other ſtarting hole of the Proteſtants, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> forſooth was juſtified before God, by onely faith: but was declared juſt before men by his workes: For if God eſteeme more of charity, then of our faith, a man is more juſtified before God by charity, then by faith: Againe, in the very place where this noble fact is recorded, to ſhew how acceptable it was to God himſelfe, it is ſaid in the perſon of God:<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> 
                           <hi>Nowe I knowe that thou loueſt me:</hi> and to conuince all obſtinate cauilling, is it not ſaid that his faith did in this very fact cooperate with his workes, and that the worke made his faith perfect: which conjunction of both of them together, doth demonſtrate that he ſpeaketh of his juſtification before God: adding alſo, <hi>That he was therefore called the friend of God.</hi> Which could not haue beene, if thereby he had beene only declared juſt before men, &amp; thus doth S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reconcile the two places of the Apoſtles, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Iames,</hi> which ſeeme contrarie. <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaying that a man is iuſtified by faith, without workes, and S.</hi> Iames, <hi>that a man is iuſtified by workes, and not by faith onely. That</hi> S. Paul <hi>ſpeaketh of workes, which goe before faith, ſuch as we of our owne forces, without the helpe of grace are able to doe: and ſuch he ſaith not to deſerue our firſt iuſtification. But</hi> S. Iames <hi>diſputeth of workes, which followe faith, and iſſue out of our ſoules, nowe garniſhed with grace, and ſuch he holdeth vs to be iuſtified by,</hi> that is, <hi>made more and more iuſt:</hi> See the place. He ſaith directly,<note place="margin">L. 83. queſt q. 76. Serm. 16. de verb. Apoſ.</note> that we are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that this juſtice doth increaſe, whiles it doth proceede and profit.</p>
                        <p>Nothing then is more certaine and cleare, then that there our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may daylie be augmented: and it ſeemeth to me, that this alſo bee graunted in their opinion: For they holding faith to be the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of juſtification, cannot deny, but that there are many degrees of faith, it is ſo plainely taught in the worde: <hi>O yee of little faith.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Math. 8. Luc. 19.</note> And then a little after, <hi>I haue not founde ſo great faith in Iſraell:</hi> And <hi>O Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our faith:</hi> and many ſuch like, where many different degrees of faith are mentioned. How then can the juſtification which dependes vpon that faith, not be correſpondent vnto that diuerſity of faith, but all one?<note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note> Againe, M. PERK. deliuereth plainly, <hi>That men at the firſt, are not ſo well aſſured of their ſaluation, as they are afterward;</hi> If then in the certainty of their ſaluation, which is the prime effect of their juſtification they put degrees, they muſt perforce allowe them in the juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe. And thus much of this queſtion:<note place="margin">Pag. 200.</note> the objections which M. PERKINS makes for vs in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21661:49"/> this Article: doe belong either to the queſtion of merits, or of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of fulfilling the lawe, or to the perfection of our juſtice: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I remitte them to thoſe places: and will handle the two latter poynts, before I come to that of merits.</p>

For veniall ſinnes, either for the ſmalneſſe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or want of conſideration, are not ſo oppoſite to the lawe, as that they violate the reaſon, and purport of it, although they be ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing with it.

                        <p>Laſtly, it may be objected that the way to heauen is ſtraite, &amp; the gate narrowe: which is ſo true, that it ſeemeth impoſſible to be kept by fleſh and bloud: but that which is impoſſible to men of themſelues, is made poſſible, and eaſie too, by the grace of God: which made S. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>I can doe all thinges in him, that ſtrengthneth and comformeth me:</hi>

                        <p>In lieu of the manifolde teſtimony of Antiquity, which doth nothing more then recommend good workes, and paint out the excellencie of them: I will ſet downe one paſſage of S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> wherein this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie is diſtinctly declared, and determined: thus he beginneth: <hi>The iuſtice (through which the iuſt man liueth by faith) becauſe it is giuen to man by the ſpiritte of grace is true iustice:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Li. 3. cont. duas epiſt. Felag. c. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>the which although it be worthely called in ſome men perfect, according to the capacitie of this life, yet it is but ſmall in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that greater, which man made equall to Angelles ſhall receiue. Which (hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly iuſtice) he that had not as yet ſaid himſelfe to be perfect, in regard of that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that was in him; and alſo imperfect; if it be compared to that which he wanted. But certainely this leſſer iuſtice, or righteouſneſſe, breedeth, and bringeth forth merittes, and that greater, is the rewarde thereof. Wherefore he that purſueth not this, ſhall not obtayne that:</hi> Hitherto S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Note firſt, that he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the juſtice which we haue in this life, to be true juſtice, which is pure from all injuſtice and iniquity: Then, that it is alſo perfect, not fayling in any dutie, which we be bound to performe. Laſtly, that it bringeth forth good workes, ſuch as merit life euerlaſting. True it is alſo, that this juſtice although perfect in itſelfe, ſo farre as mans capacity in this life doth permitte: yet being compared vnto the ſtate of juſtice which is in heauen, it may be called imperfect, not that this is not ſufficient to defend vs from all formall tranſgreſsion of Gods lawe: but becauſe it keepeth not vs ſometimes from veniall ſinne: and hath not ſuch a high degree of perfection as that hath.<note place="margin">De ſpir. &amp; lit. vlt. cap.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath the like diſcourſe, where he ſaith directly, that it appertaines to the leſſer juſtice of this life, not to ſinne.

                        <p>To theſe reaſons taken partly out of the Scriptures, and partly out of the record of Antiquity, let vs joyne one or two drawne from the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of our aduerſaries doctrine, which teacheth euery good woorke of the righteous man to be infected with mortall ſin: Which being graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it would followe neceſſarily, that no good worke in the world, were to be donne vnder paine of damnation: thus: <hi>No mortall ſinne is to be donne vnder paine of damnation:</hi>

                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:21661:51"/> It followeth ſecondly, that euery man is bounde to ſinne deadly. For all men are bounde to performe the duties of the firſt and ſecond table: but euery performance of any dutie is neceſſary linked with ſome mortall ſinne: therefore euery man is bounde to committe many mortall ſinnes: and conſequently to be damned.

And in this reſpect S. <hi>Iames</hi> compareth them together: Now there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points wherein theſe faithes doe differ, but this one is principall. That Chriſtians out of a goodly and deuoute affection, doe willingly ſubmitte their vnderſtanding vnto the rules of faith, beleeuing thinges aboue hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, yea ſuch as ſeeme ſometimes contrary to it. But the Diuell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will, beleeues all that God hath reuealed: Becauſe by his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall capacity he knowes that God can teach, nor teſtifie any vntruth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that faith may be without charity is proued out of theſe wordes of the ſame ſecond Chapter. <hi>Euer as the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo alſo faith without workes is dead.</hi> Hence thus I argue: albeit the body be dead without the ſoule: yet is it a true naturall body in it ſelfe, euen ſo faith is perfect in the kinde of faith, although without charity it auayle not to life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. Laſtly in true reaſon it is manifeſt that faith may be without chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for they haue ſeuerall ſeates in the ſoule, one being in the will, and the other in the vnderſtanding: they haue diſtinct objectes, faith reſpecting the truth of God, and charity the goodnes of God. Neither doth faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſe charity, as charity doth faith, for we cannot loue him of whom we neuer heard.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21661:55"/> he ſaith that they haue no other meritte then Chriſts imputed to them, as they haue no other righteouſnes, but by imputation, I take it to be true: and therefore they doe very ingenuouſly and juſtly, renounce all kinde of merittes in their ſtayned and defiled workes. But let them tremble at that which thereupon neceſſarily followeth. It is; that as they haue no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes nor meritte of heauen, but only by a ſuppoſed imputation, ſo they muſt looke for no heauen, but by imputation: for God as a moſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right judge wil in the end repay euery man, according to his worth: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not finding any reall worthines in Proteſtants, but only in conceipte: his reward ſhall be giuen them anſwerably, in conceipte only: which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently gathered out of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> where he ſaith.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de morib. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ cap. 25</note> 
                           <hi>That the reward cannot goe before the merite, nor be giuen to a man before he be worthy of it: for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what were more iniuſt then that, and what is more iuſt then God.</hi> Where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth that we muſt not be ſo hardy as once to demaund, much leſſe ſo impudent as to aſſure our ſelues of that crowne, before we haue deſerued it. Seing then that the Proteſtants by this their proctour renounce all ſuch meritte and deſart, they muſt needes alſo renounce their part of heauen, &amp; not preſume ſo much as once to demaund according vnto S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> ſentence: vntill they haue firſt renounced their erronious opinions.</p>
                        <p>But M. PERKINS will neuertheleſſe proue, and that by ſundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that their doctrine is the truth it ſelfe, and ours falſhood.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, by a ſorry ſhort ſillogiſme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayning more then one whole page. It is taken out of the properties of a meritorious worke: Which muſt be (ſaith he) four. Firſt, <hi>That the worke be done of ourſelues, without the helpe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That it be not otherwiſe due debt.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That it be done to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of an other.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That the worke and reward be equall in proportion.</hi> Theſe proprieties he ſets downe pithagorically without any proofe. But infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thereon, as though he had proued them inuincibly, that Chriſts man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſeperated from the Godhead cannot meritte: becauſe whatſoeuer he doth, he doeth it by grace receiued, &amp; ſhould be otherwiſe due. He might in like manner as truly ſay, that Chriſts manhood vnited to the Godhead could not merite neither: for he receiued his Godhead from his father, &amp; whatſoeuer he doth is therefore his Fathers by due debt. And ſo the good man, if he were let alone, would diſapoint vs wholy of all merites, aſwell the imputed of Chriſts, as of all ours done by vertue of his grace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt a little ſift his foure forged proprieties of merit: and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt. I ſay that one may by the good vſe of a thing receiued by free gift, merit and deſerue much euen at his handes that gaue it. For example the Father beſtowes a farme vpon his Son freely: Who may by often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his Father of the pleaſing fruits growing on the ſame, deſerue his further fauour: Yea, he may by the commodities, reaped out of that farme,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21661:56"/> buy any thing that it ſhall pleaſe his father to ſet to ſale, as well as if he had neuer receiued the farme from his fathers gift. Which is ſo common a caſe, and ſo ſenſible, that euery man of meane witte, may eaſely reach vnto it: euen ſo by good manuring the giftes which God freely beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon vs, we may both merit the increaſe of them, and according to his owne order and promiſe, purchaſe thereby the kingdome of heauen, which is plainely proued by that parable,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
                           <hi>Of the talents giuen by a King to his ſeruants;</hi> the which they imploying well, and multiplying, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſteemed worthy of farre greater, and withall to be made pertakers of their Lordes joyes.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS then was not a little ouerſeene, to put for the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of merit, that it muſt be donne by a man, and of a man himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, <hi>That a man muſt doe it of his owne free will and pleaſure, and not of due debt:</hi> carrieth in ſhewe an oppoſition. but in deede there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it: for a man may, and euery honeſt man doth, of his owne free will and pleaſure, pay his due debt: but let vs pardon the diſorder of wordes: his meaning being nothing elſe, but that the payment of that which is otherwiſe due debt, cannot be any meritorious worke, to which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth anſwere in theſe wordes.<note place="margin">Serm. 3. de verb Apoſt</note> 
                           <hi>O great goodneſſe of God, to whome when we did owe ſeruice by condition of our eſtate, as bond-men doe to their Lord, yet hath he promiſed againe and againe, the rewarde of friendes.</hi> In which there is couched a compariſon, which being laide in the light, will much helpe to the vnderſtanding of this matter. He that hath a ſlaue, or bond-man, may lawfully exact of him all kinde of ſeruice, without any wages: <hi>Bread and a whippe</hi> (ſaith a Philoſopher) <hi>ſerue for a ſlaue:</hi> Now ſuppoſe the Maſter to be ſoueraigne gouernour of a ſtate: then if it pleaſe him to make his man free, and withall a member of his common weale, the ſame man by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming many good offices to the ſtate, may juſtly deſerue of his prince as great rewarde and promotion, as any other of his ſubjects: and yet may his Lord and olde Maſter ſay trulie to him, all this that thou haſt donne, or couldſt doe, is but due debt vnto me, conſidering that thou waſt my bond man. ſo fareth it with vs in reſpect of God: all that we can doe, is due debt vnto him, becauſe he hath made vs, and endowed vs, with all that we either be, or haue: yet it hath pleaſed him, as a moſt kinde Lord, to ſet vs at liberty through Chriſt, and to make vs Citizens of the Saints, and as capable of his heauenly riches, as the Angelles, if wee will doe our endeuour to deſerue them: and whereas hee might haue exacted all that euer we could doe, without any kinde of recompence: yet hee of his ineſtimable goodneſſe towardes vs, doth neither binde vs to doe all we can doe; and yet for doing that little which he commaundeth, hath by promiſe bound himſelfe to repay vs a large recompence: by which wee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21661:56"/> may well vnderſtand thoſe wordes of our Sauiour:<note place="margin">Luke 17.</note> 
                           <hi>When you haue donne all theſe thinges that are commaunded you, ſay that you are vnprofitable ſeruantes: we haue donne that we ought to doe.</hi> True. By our natiue condition we were bounde to performe, not only all theſe thinges, that be now commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but whatſoeuer elſe it ſhould haue pleaſed God to commaund: and this we muſt alwaies confeſſe, to preſerue true humility in vs: yet God hath bettered our eſtate through Chriſt, and ſo highly aduaunced vs, that we not only be Citizens of the Saints, but his ſons and heires, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in caſe to deſerue of him, a heauenly crowne, and this is S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition vpon the place. S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> pondering theſe wordes <hi>let vs ſay,</hi> taketh it for a holſome counſaile for vs to ſay, that we be vnprofitable ſeruants, leaſt pride deſtroy our good workes: and then God will ſay, that we be good and faithfull ſeruants, as it is recorded.<note place="margin">Mat. 25. verſ. 21.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Againe, we may truly ſay, when we haue donne all thinges commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that we are vnprofitable ſeruants, as venerable <hi>Bede</hi> our moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned countriman interpreteth: <hi>Becauſe of all that we doe,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In Luc. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>no commodity riſeth vnto God our Lord in himſelfe: who is ſuch an infinite ocean of all goodneſſes, that he wanteth nothing:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>That thou art my God, becauſe thou ſtandeſt in neede of no good that I can doe.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>And thus we fall vpon the third property of M. PERKINS merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious worke. Which is, <hi>That it be donne to the profit of another:</hi> and ſay that albeit God in himſelfe receiue no profit, by our workes: yet doth he in the adminiſtration of his holy common weale the Church, wherein good mens ſeruices doe much pleaſure him. Andin this ſence is it ſaid of S. <hi>Paul, That by cleanſing our ſelues from wicked workes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. Math. 5. Ioh. 15. v. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>we ſhall become veſſelles ſanctified, and profitable vnto our Lord.</hi> Againe, <hi>God is glorified by our good workes, That ſeeing your good workes, they may glorifie your father which is in heauen.</hi> Finally, <hi>God doth reioyce at the recouery of his loſt children.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> If then good men trauayling painefully in Gods Vine-yarde, doe yeelde him outwardly both honour, joy, and commodity: that may ſuffice to make their worke meritorious.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS fourth property is, <hi>That the worke and rewarde, be equall in proportion:</hi> If he vnderſtande Arithmeticall proportion, that is, that they be equall in quantity, to witte, the one to be as great, or of as long continuance as the other: then we deny this kinde of equality to bee requiſite to meritte: there is another ſort of proportion, called by the Philoſopher S. <hi>Athic.</hi> Geometricall: and the equality of that is taken by a reaſonable correſpondence of the one vnto the other: as when a good office is giuen vnto a Citizen of deſart, it may be, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and commodity. of the office is farre greater, then was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritte of the man: yet he being as well able to diſcharge it as another,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21661:57"/> and hauing better deſerued it, is holden in true juſtice vvorthy of it: In like manner in a game where maſteries are tryed, the prize is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him that doeth beſt, not becauſe the value of the rewarde, is juſt as much worth, as that act of the man who winneth it: but for that ſuch actiuity is eſteemed worthy of ſuch a recompence. Now the crowne of heauenly glory,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> is likened by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> vnto a Garland in a game: where he ſaith, <hi>That we all runne, but one carrieth away the prize.</hi> And <hi>He that ſtriueth for the maſtery,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>is not crowned, vnleſſe he ſtriue lawfully.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reſembled vnto places of honour.<note place="margin">Math. 25. Ioh. 14. Mat. 13. 1. Ioh. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>I will place thee ouer much.</hi> And <hi>I goe to prouide you places.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Grace is alſo in many places of Scripture, compared to ſeede: <hi>For the ſeede of God tarrieth in him.</hi> But a little ſeede caſt into good ground, and well manured, bringeth forth abundance of corne. Briefly, then ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality as there is betweene the well deſeruing ſubject, and the office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him that ſtriueth lawfully, and the crowne, betweene the ſeede, and the corne, is betweene the reward of heauen, and the merit of a true ſeruant of God.</p>
                        <p>And thus much of M. PERKINS firſt Argument, more indeede to explicate the nature and condition of merit, then that his reaſon nakedly propoſed, did require it.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Exod 20.</note>His ſecond teſtimony is, <hi>God will ſhewe mercy vpon thouſandes, in them that loue him, and keepe his commaundements.</hi> Hence he reaſoneth thus: <hi>Where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is giuen vpon mercy, there is no merit: but reward is giuen vpon mercy, as the text proueth,</hi> ergo.</p>

                        <p>Now to thoſe textes cited before about juſtification,<note place="margin">Ad Eph. 2.</note>

                        <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth firſt, that the reward is of meere mercy without any thing donne by men. But this is moſt apparantly falſe: for the Scripture expreſſeth the very workes whereof it is a reward: Againe, a reward in Engliſh ſuppoſeth ſome former pleaſure, which is rewarded, otherwiſe it were to be called a gift, and not a reward: and much more the Latin, and Greeke word, <hi>Miſos, Merus,</hi> which rather ſignifie a mans hier and wagis, then a gift or rewarde: Wherefore M.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> We knowe well that it is an inheritance, becauſe it is onely due vnto the adopted Sonnes of God: but that hindreth not it to be a reward, for that it is our heauenly fathers pleaſure, that all his Sonnes comming to the yeares of diſcretion, ſhall by their good carriage either deſerue it, or elſe for their badde behauiour be diſinherited.</p>
                        <p>M.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21661:59"/> ſaith that great is their reward, who are reuiled and perſecuted for his ſake.

                           <hi>Come vnto me yee bleſſed of my father, poſſeſſe a Kingdome prepared for you:</hi> And why ſo? <hi>For when I was hungry, yee gaue me meate.</hi> And ſo forth: the like is in the ſame Chapter of the ſeruants, who imployed well their talentes: for their Lord ſaid vnto them. <hi>Becauſe you haue beene faithfull in fewe thinges, I will place you ouer many.</hi> And many ſuch like; where good workes donne by the parties themſelues are expreſly ſaid to be the very cauſe, why God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth them with the Kingdome of heauen: Therefore he muſt needes be holden for a very wrangler, that doth ſeeke to peruert ſuch euident ſpeeches, and would make the ſimple beleeue, that the cauſe there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally ſpecified, is not to be taken for the cauſe, but doth onely ſignifie an order of thinges.

Of the reall imputation of Chriſts merittes, there vvas no tydinges in thoſe dayes: And that iuditious Doctor, found that good workes was the cauſe of receiuing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Here by the way Maſter PERKINS redoubleth that common ſlaunder of theirs: that we take away a part of Chriſts media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>For ſaith he, if Chriſts merittes were ſufficient, what neede ours?</hi> It hath beene often told them, but they will neuer learne to vnderſtand it: I will yet once againe repeate it. We hold our Sauiours merits to be of infinite value, and to haue deſerued of God all the graces and bleſſinges, which hath or ſhall be beſtowed vpon all men, from the beginning of the world vnto the end of it: yet his diuine will and order, is that all men of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hauing freely receiued grace from him, doe meritte that crowne of glory, which is prepared for them, not to ſupply the want of his merittes, which are ineſtimable, but being members of his miſticall body, he would haue vs alſo like vnto himſelfe in this point of meriting: and further deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to trayne vs vp in all good works, he beſt knewe, that there could be no better ſpur to pricke our dull nature forward, then to ordayne and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21661:60"/> ſuch heauenly rewardes vnto all them, that would diligently ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to deſerue them. The man ſeemes to be much ignorant in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Chriſtes mediation: I will therefore helpe him a little. It conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in reconciling man to God: which he performed by paying the ranſome of our ſinnes, in purchaſing vs Gods fauour, and in ordayning meanes how all mankinde might attayne to eternall life: in the two firſt poynts, we doe for the moſt part agree: to witte, that our ſinnes are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardoned through Chriſtes paſſion: and that we are as freely juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and receiued, firſt into Gods grace and fauour: although we require other preparation then they doe, yet we as fully deny any merit of ours to be cauſe of either, as they doe. Marry about the meanes of attayning to heauen, we differ altogether: for they ſay that God requires no juſtice in vs, nor merit at all on our partes, but only the diſpoſition of faith, to lay holde on Chriſtes righteouſnes and merittes: but we ſay that Chriſtes righteouſnes and merit, are incommunicable vnto any meere creature: but that through his merittes, God doth powre into euery true Chriſtian, a particular juſtice, whereby he is ſanctified, and made able to doe good workes, and to merit eternall life. Which ability we receiuing of Gods free gift, through Chriſtes merits, doth much more magnifie both Gods grace, and Chriſtes merittes: for the greater that the gift is, the greater is, the glory of the giuer. And to argue that to be a derogation vnto his mediation and merits, whith he hath appoynted to be very inſtrument of applying the vertue of them to vs, is indeede vnder colour of magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts merittes, to vndermine, and blowe out all the vertue of them. But ſaies M. PERKINS, what ſhould we talke of our merittes, who for one good worke we doe, committe many bad, which deface our merits, if we had any.</p>
                        <p>True it is, as it was once before ſaid, that euery mortall ſinne, blotteth out all former juſtice and merit: but by repentance, both are recouered againe: but muſt we not ſpeake of any good, becauſe we may happe to doe euill? that is a faire perſwaſion, and well worthy a wiſe man.</p>
                        <p>Let vs to our third Argument? God hath by couenant and promiſe, bound himſelfe to reward our workes with life euerlaſting: Therefore good workes doe in juſtice deſerue it: for faithfull promiſe maketh due debt.<note place="margin">Math. 20.</note> The couenant is plainely ſet downe: where God in the perſon of an houſholder agreeth with his workmen, for a penny a day: that is, to giue them life euerlaſting for trauayling in his ſeruice during their life time, as all auncient interpretours expound it. Whereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> inferreth,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> that God ſhould be vnjuſt, if he ſhould forgette their workes, who ſuffered perſecution for him:<note place="margin">2.

                           <hi>Great truly were the iniuſtice of God, if he did only puniſh euill workes, and would not as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue good workes.</hi> To all theſe, and much more ſuch like, M. PERKINS anſwereth, that couenant for workes was in the olde Teſtament, but in the newe, the couenant is made with the workman, not with the worke.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> All that I cited in this Argument, is out of the newe Teſtament, where expreſſe couenant is made for working, and workes, as you haue heard. And as it was ſaid in the olde lawe,<note place="margin">Math 19.</note> 
                           <hi>Doe theſe thinges and thou ſhalt liue:</hi> ſo is it ſaid in the newe, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> and life eternall, is the hire, and wages, for labouring in Gods vine-yard, and not of the imputed juſtice, or merittes of Chriſt: but looke about you, and beholde the goodly marke which M. PERKINS ſets vp: Marke ſaith he, that it is ſaid, God will render vnto euery man according to his workes: not to the worke, or for the worke. O ſharpe and ouer-fine witte? doth he render according to the workes, and doth he not render for the workes? if the rate of the workes be the meaſure of the rewarde, that for fewer or leſſer workes, there is a leſſer reward, and for many and worthier, a greater: ſurely, in my ſimple vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he that giueth according vnto the workes, giueth for the workes that other addle inuention (that workes are there mentioned, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are rewarded, but becauſe they are tokens, that the doer is in CHRIST, for whoſe obedience God promiſeth the crowne of life) is not worth the confuting, it is ſo flat contrary to the text: which aſcribeth diſtinctly that reward vnto the workman for his workes, and not for Chriſts obedience imputed vnto him.</p>
                        <p>M. PERKINS fourth objection for vs, is propoſed vnskilfully, yet could he not anſwere it, but by relying vpon that which is moſt vntrue, that forſooth no one action of the beſt man is vvithout fault: which hath beene already confuted, and might be by inſtances of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahames</hi> oblation of his ſonne, S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> preaching, and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Herode <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                           <note place="margin">Mat. 6.

It was then a verie ſeelie ſhift to ſay, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any man did any one action, with all his due circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>But in ſteede of that fourth Argument, I will put this: If a greater rewarde be due vnto them that doe better workes, then a reward is due vnto them that doe good workes, which is euident in reaſon: But a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rewarde is prouided for them that doe better as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

                        <p>The ſixt reaſon M. PERKINS deliuereth thus:<note place="margin">2.

M.

                        <p>Secondly he anſwereth, that it is called a crowne of juſtice, becauſe God hath bound himſelfe by his promiſe to giue it: here then at length we haue by his owne confeſsion, that by Gods promiſe, eternall life is due debt vnto the righteous: but as hauing ouer-ſhot himſelfe, he addes, not for any deſart of theirs, but only for the promiſe ſake.

                        <hi>that is, a recompence for iniuries or damages any way donne to our neighbour: ſuch as the good Publican</hi> Zacheus <hi>practiſed, who reſtored fourfold the thinges gotten by extorſion and deceite.</hi> This is,<note place="margin">Luc. 19.</note> wittily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, but litle exerciſed among Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, for where the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confeſſion is wanting, there men vſe very ſeldome to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ſo much as onefold, for their extorſion, bribes, vſury, and other crafty ouer-reaching of their neighbours. But of this kinde of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we commonly call reſtitution, we are not here to treate: nor of that publicke penance. Which for notorious crimes is done openly: but of ſuch priuate penance, which is either enjoyned by the confeſſor, or voluntarily vndertaken by the penitent, or elſe ſent by Gods viſitation to purge vs from that temporall payne, which for ſinnes paſt and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we are to endure, either in this life, or in purgatorie, if we die before we haue fully ſatisfied here.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS in his third concluſion, decreeth very ſolemnely, <hi>That no man can be ſaued, vnleſſe he made a perfect ſatisfaction, vnto the iuſtice of God, for all his ſinnes.</hi> Yet in the explication of the difference betweene vs defineth as peremptorily, that no man is to ſatisfie, for any one of all his ſinnes, or for any temporall payne due to them: Which be flat contradictory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and therefore the one of them muſt needes be falſe. But ſuch odde broken rubbiſh doth he commonly caſt into the ground worke of his queſtions, and thereupon raiſeth the tottering building of his newe doctrine: and lets not, like a blinde man, to make an out cry, that in this matter the Papiſts erre in the very foundation and life of religion: Which in his firſt argument he goes about to proue thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Imperfect ſatisfaction, is no ſatisfaction at all: But the Papiſts make Chriſts ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction imperfect, in that they doe thereunto adde a ſupply of humane ſatisfaction:</hi> ergo. <hi>they make it no ſatisfaction at all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwere.</hi> This is a ſubſtantiall argument to raiſe the cry vpon: which hath both propoſitions falſe. The firſt is childiſh: for he that ſatisfieth for halfe his debts, or for any part of them, makes ſome ſatisfaction, which ſatisfaction is vnperfect, and yet cannot be called no ſatisfaction at all, as euery child may ſee. His ſecond is as vntrue: but mans ſatisfaction is not to ſupply the want of Chriſts ſatisfaction, but to apply it to vs, as Maſter PERKINS ſaith, his faith doth to them, and to fulfill his will and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce.</p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:21661:63"/>
                     <p>God doth in baptiſme for Chriſts ſake pardon both all ſinnes, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fully away, all payne due to ſinne, ſo that he who dieth in that ſtate, goeth preſently to heauen. But if we doe afterward vngratefully forſake God, and contrary to our promiſe tranſgreſſe againſt his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, then loe the order of his diuine juſtice requires, that we be not ſo eaſely receiued againe into his fauour: But he vpon our repentance par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the ſinne, and the eternall puniſhment due vnto it, through Chriſt, doth exact of euery man a temporall ſatisfaction, anſwerable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fault committed: not to ſupply Chriſts ſatisfaction, which was of infinite value, and might more eaſely haue taken away this temporall puniſhment, then it doth the eternall. But, that by the ſmarte and griefe of this puniſhment, the man may be feared from ſinning, and be made more carefull to auoyde ſinne: and alſo by this meanes be made members conformable to Chriſt our head, that ſuffering with him, we may raigne with him. And therefore he hauing ſatisfied for the eternall puniſhment, which wee are not able to doe, doth lay the temporall payne vpon our ſhoulders,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> that according vnto the Apoſtle. <hi>Euerie man doe beare his owne burden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay (ſaith M. PERKINS,) we muſt then be newe Chriſts, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers, and Prieſtes of the ſame order with himſelfe: Nothing ſo, but hauing grace from him, we may in vertue thereof ſatisfie, not for the crime it ſelfe, or euerlaſting puniſhment, which is lincked with it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would require an infinite vertue: But for the temporall payne of it, one indued with grace may ſatisfie, for the meaſure of ſtripes muſt not exceede the rate of the fault, the puniſhment then reſting vnſatisfied being limited, a creature may pay it. And that the Reader may better perceiue what we meane by the temporall payne: Let him conſider that in ſinne are two thinges, the one is the turning away from God, whome we offend, the other is the turning vnto the thing, for the loue of which we offend: as for glory, luſt, lucre, or ſuch like the ſinner tranſgreſſeth: Now when he is by the grace of God conuerted, his turning away from God, both the ſinne and the eternall payne due vnto it, are freely through Chriſt pardoned, but for the pleaſure which he tooke in the ſinne, the man himſelfe is to ſatisfie: and ſo according vnto the greatnes of that his pleaſure, he is to doe penance.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt (ſaith Maſter PERKINS) ſaid. <hi>On the Croſſe it is finiſhed: Wherefore all ſatisfaction was at</hi> CHRISTS <hi>death ended: as well temporall as eternall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwere.</hi> That thoſe wordes haue a farre different ſence: To wit, that Chriſt had then ended his courſe, and fulfilled all prophecies, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all ſuch tormentes, as he pleaſed God to impoſe vpon him for the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21661:63"/> redemption of mankinde: of ſatisfaction temporall there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither can any thing be drawne thence againſt it: No more can bee out of this other. <hi>Christ made ſinne for vs:</hi> That is,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne, as Maſter PERKINS gloſeth it: but the learned ſay, an hoaſt or ſacrifice for ſinne. But we graunt that he ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for our ſinne, and ſay conſequently: that all ſinne is pardoned freely for his ſake, and the payne of hell alſo, which is puniſhment of ſinne: but not other temporall paynes, ſuch as it hath pleaſed the juſtice and wiſedome of God, to reſerue vnto euery ſinner, to beare in his owne perſon. And after this ſorte, and no other was God in Chriſt, reconciling the world to him ſelfe: And that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vnderſtood well, that Chriſts ſufferinges did not take away ours, may be gathered by theſe his wordes. <hi>I reioyce in ſuffering for you,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Colloſ. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>and doe accompliſh thoſe thinges, that want of the Paſsions of Christ, in my fleſh for his body, which is the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But of this point more, when we come vnto the Argumentes for the Catholike part.</p>
                     <p>Nowe to M. PERKINS ſecond reaſon. <hi>In ſundry places</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of Scripture, we are ſaid to be redeemed, iuſtified, and ſaued freely: but this word freely importeth that we are ſaued without doeing any thing our ſelues in that matter of ſaluation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Not ſo good Sir, for euen in your owne Doctrine, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that yee beleeue, and bringe forth the fruites of repentance, and that nowe and then, yee make ſome ſhort prayers, and receiue the communion, and doe many other odde thinges in that matter of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Wherefore the word freely doth not exclude all our working, and ſuffering in that matter.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS third reaſon. <hi>We pray daily forgiue vs our ſinnes: Nowe to plead pardon, and to ſatisfie for our ſinnes, are cleane contrary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwere.</hi> If our ſinnes be mortall, we craue pardon both of the ſinne, and the eternall puniſhment annexed, and doe willingly withall ſatisfie for the temporall payne: as the man who is conuicted of high treaſon, and hauing both his life, honour, landes, and goodes, pardoned and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, doth very joyfully endure three monethes impriſonment, and any reaſonable fine ſette on his head. If our ſinnes be veniall: then that prayer is a ſpeciall meane, both to obtayne pardon of the fault, and releaſe of all the payne, as witneſſeth S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſaying.<note place="margin">In Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid c. 71.</note> 
                        <hi>That for the daylie, ſhort, and light offences, without which this life is not ledde, the daylie prayer of the faithfull doth ſatisfie.</hi> And that is not true which Maſter PERKINS addes, that wee are taught in that prayer, wholy and only, to vſe the plea of Pardon. For in the ſame petition, wee are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21661:64"/> taught alſo to pardon others, euen as we will looke to be pardoned. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if there were only a plea of pardon, it would not ſerue M. PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS purpoſe. For who would ſay, that within the compaſſe of the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> all thinges neceſſary to ſaluation be conteyned: beſides pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is one part of ſatisfaction, as ſhall be proued hereafter: and ſo by oft praying for pardon, we may well ſatisfie for much temporall punniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS fourth Argument is taken out of certaine odde frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of auncient writers.</p>

                        <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Such excellent holy perſonages ſufferinges as are mentioned in the Scriptures, were not for their ſinnes: for they committed but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary light offences, for which their ordinary deuotions ſatisfied abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21661:65"/> the great perſecutions which they endured were firſt to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the vertue and power of God, that made ſuch fraile creatures ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible, then to daunt the aduerſaries of his truth, and with all, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and encourage his followers. Finally, that they like conquerours triumphing ouer all the torments of this life, might enter into poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a greater reward in the kingdome of heauen. All this is good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but nothing againſt ſatisfaction, that their ſurpaſsing ſuffering, were not for their owne ſinnes: and thus much in anſwere vnto M. PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS Arguments againſt ſatisfaction. Now to the reaſons which he produceth for it.</p>
                     <p>And albeit he like an euill maſter of the campe, rang our Arguments out of order,<note place="margin">Li. 3. inſtit. cap. 4. num. 29.</note> placing that in the fore-front of our ſide, vvhich <hi>Caluin</hi> preſſeth out againſt vs, yet will I admitte of it, rather then breake his order.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Leui. 4.5.6</note>1. <hi>Moyſes according to Gods commaundement preſcribed ſeuerall ſacrifices, for the ſinnes of ſeuerall perſons, and ordeyned, that they ſhould be of greater and leſſer prices, according vnto the diuerſity of the ſinnes.</hi> Whence we argue thus: Theſe mens faultes vpon their true repentance, joyned with faith and hope in CHRIST to come were pardoned: Therefore their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in buying of ſacrifices to bee offered for them, their paines, and prayers in aſsiſting during the time of the ſacrifice, being painefull vvorkes donne to appeaſe GODS juſtice, were vvorkes of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth, many thinges as men doe commonly when they cannot well tell what to ſay directly to the purpoſe: Firſt, that thoſe ſacrifices, were tipes of Chriſtes ſuffering on the croſſe: what is this to the purpoſe? Secondly, that thoſe ſacrifices were ſatisfactions to the congregation, and what needed that, when they had offended God only, and not the congregation, as in many offences it happeneth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if ſatisfaction muſt be giuen to the congregation, how much more reaſon is it, that it be made to God? Reade thoſe Chapters, and you ſhall finde, that they were principally made, to obtayne remiſsion of God: as theſe wordes alſo doe witneſſe:<note place="margin">Leuit. 4. verſ. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>And vpon that ſacrifice, the ſinne ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen them:</hi> So that ſacrifices were to ſatisfie God, who thereupon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue the ſinne, and all paine due to it.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon for vs (which indeede is the very ground worke of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) may thus be framed: many after pardon obtayned of their ſinnes, haue had temporall puniſhment laide vpon them for the ſame ſinnes, and that by Gods owne order: wherefore after the forgiuenes of the ſinne, and the eternall puniſhment of it through Chriſts ſatisfaction, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth ſome temporall paine to be endured by the party himſelfe for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21661:65"/> the ſame ſinne: which is moſt properly that which we call ſatisfaction. They deny that any man hath beene puniſhed temporally for any ſinne, which was once pardoned: we proue it firſt by the example of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, whoſe murmuration againſt GOD,<note place="margin">Numb. 14.</note> was at <hi>Moyſes</hi> interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion pardoned: yet all the elder ſort of them, who had ſeene the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought in Egipt for their deliuerance, were by the ſentence of God depriued of the ſight of the Land of promiſe, and puniſhed with death in the wilderneſſe, for the very ſame their murmuration. The like judgement was giuen againſt <hi>Moyſes</hi> himſelfe and <hi>Aaron,</hi> for not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying God at the waters of contradiction:<note place="margin">Numb 20. Deut. 32.</note> both of them had their ſinne pardoned, yet were they both afterward for the ſame debarred from the entrance into the holy land.</p>
                     <p>To this M. PERKINS anſwereth, firſt, that man muſt be conſidered in a two folde eſtate, as he is vnder the lawe, and as he is vnder grace: In the former eſtate, all afflictions were curſes of the lawe: in the latter, they are turned vnto them that beleeue in Chriſt, from curſes into triales, corrections, preuentions, admonitions, inſtructions, and into what you will elſe, ſauing ſatisfaction. Now to the purpoſe: Whereas God (ſaith he) denied the beleeuing Iſraelites, with <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to enter into the land of Canaan, it cannot be proued that it was a puniſhment, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the lawe laide vpon them: the Scripture hath no more but that it was an admonition vnto all ages following, to take heede of like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth: <hi>All theſe thinges came vnto them for examples,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>and were written for our admonition.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> He that will not be aſhamed of this audatious aſſertion, needes not to care what he ſaith: Hath the Scripture no more of their fact, then that it was an admonition to others? Turne to the originall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where the whole matter in particular is related: Firſt their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muration, then <hi>Moyſes</hi> interceſsion for them, and the obtayning of their pardon, and laſtly, after all the reſt, Gods ſentence of depriuation of them from entring into the land of promiſe, for that their murmuration:<note place="margin">Numb. 14. Numb. 20. verſ. 24. Deut. 32.51.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhall not enter into the land, becauſe he hath beene diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to my voyce: and of <hi>Moyſes Becauſe he hath treſpaſſed againſt me at the waters of ſtrife.</hi> So that nothing is more cleare euen by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the holy Ghoſt, then that their dayes were ſhortened, and their hope of entrance into the land of promiſe cutte off, in puniſhment of thoſe offences, which were before forgiuen them. And theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtefieth, for our admonition and inſtruction: we are to learne thereby, that God ſo dealeth daiely with all thoſe ſinners that he calleth to repentance.</p>
                     <p>Now to the next example, which M. PER. maketh our third reaſon.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21661:66"/> King <hi>Dauid</hi> was puniſhed for his aduoultry after his repentance, for the child died,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 12.</note> and was plagued in the ſame kinde of inceſt by <hi>Abſolon.</hi> And when he had numbred the people,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 24.</note> he was after his owne repentance, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the death of his people.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS anſwereth, that the hand of God was vpon him after his repentance: but thoſe judgementes which befell him, were not curſes to him properly, but corrections of his ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> What dotage is this to graunt the very ſame thing, which he would be thought to denie: but yet in other tearmes, that the ſimple (whome onely he can beguile) may not perceiue it: If the hand of God were vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> correcting him for his ſinne, and that after his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: did not <hi>Dauid</hi> then ſuffer temporall puniſhment for his ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forgiuen: Which is moſt properly to ſatisfie for them. Yea ouer and beſide this puniſhment inflicted by God, he of his owne deuotion perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med farre greater ſatisfaction, by putting on ſacke-cloath, lying one the bare ground, by watering his couche with teares, and making aſhes his foode, and in this moſt pittifull plight, he made moſt humble ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto God, to waſh him more and more from his iniquity: he neuer dreamed that this his ſatisfaction, ſhould be any derogation vnto the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Lord and Sauiour:<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> but in the Pſalme ſaith. <hi>That ſuch an humble and contrite hart, is a ſweete ſacrifice vnto God.</hi> We denie not but the puniſhing of one, is a warning &amp; admonition vnto an other, to take heede of the like: ſo may not they deny, but that correction is to the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as an admonition to beware afterward, ſo a correction &amp; puniſhment of the fault paſt.<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> Which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon this verſe of the Pſalme. <hi>Thou haſt loued truth,</hi> teacheth moſt playnelie: ſaying. <hi>Thou haſt not left their ſinnes whome thou dideſt pardon, vnpuniſhed: for thou before dideſt ſo ſhewe mercy, that thou mighteſt alſo preſerue truth: thou doeſt pardon him, that confeſſeth his fault, thou doeſt pardon him, but ſo as be doe puniſhe himſelfe: and by that meanes both mercy &amp; truth are preſerued.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our fourth reaſon: the Prophetes of God, when the people were threatned with Famine, the Sword, the Plague, or ſuch like puniſhmentes for their ſinnes, did commonly exhort them to workes of penance, as faſting, prayer, haire-cloath, and the like to appeaſe Gods wrath juſtly, kindled againſt them: which being performed by them, God was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. So (for example ſake) the Nimuites at <hi>Ionas</hi> preaching, doeing penance in ſacke-cloath and aſhes, turned away the ſentence of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                     <p>M PERKINS anſwereth, that famine, the plague, and ſuch like ſcourges of God, were not puniſhments of ſinnes, but corrections of a Father.</p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:21661:66"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> This is moſt flat againſt a thouſand expreſſe textes of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: which declare that for the tranſgreſſions of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he hath ſent thoſe puniſhments vpon the people of Iſraell. And what is the correction of a Father, but the puniſhing of a ſhrewde ſonne for ſome fault committed, yet in a milde ſorte? Or doth the Schoolmaſter (which is <hi>Caluins</hi> example) whippe the Scholer, or ſtrike him with the ferula, but to puniſh him for ſome fault? So that great Rabbins ſeeme not to vnderſtand, what they ſay them ſelues, when they admitte thoſe ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God to be the corrections of a Father, but not the puniſhment for a fault. As though Fathers vſed to correct thoſe Sonnes, who neuer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them? Or Maſters to beate ſuch Scholers as committe no faultes.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith M. PERKINS, theſe puniſhments be tending to correction, not ſeruing for ſatisfaction: what ſenceles ryming is this? By due corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the fault, the party is ſatisfied in juſtice: and when he that hath offended, doth abide ſuch puniſhment as the grieuouſnes of his offence did require, there is both due correction of the offendour, and due ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction vnto the party offended.</p>
                     <p>M. PERKINS finally flieth vnto his old ſhift of imputatiue ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: that forſooth our ſufferinges doe not ſatisfie, but the party puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by faith layeth hold on the ſatisfaction of the Meſſias, and teſtifie the ſame by their humiliation, and repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> As we firſt graunt that all ſatisfaction hath his vertue, from the grace of God, dwelling in vs, which is giuen vs for Chriſts ſake: ſo to ſay that Chriſts ſatisfaction taketh away all other ſatisfaction, is juſt to begge the principall point in queſtion, and therefore an old triuants tricke, to giue that a finall anſwere, which was ſet in the beginning to be debated: looke vpon the forenamed example of the Niniuites, of whome it is not certayne that they had any expreſſe knowledge of the Meſſias, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were farre enough off from laying hold on his ſatisfaction. But moſt certayne and euident it is in the text, that God vpon the contemplation of their workes of penance, tooke compaſſion on them, and was ſatisfied; as by turning away the threatned ſubuertion is moſt manifeſt.</p>

Reuenge as euery ſimple body knoweth, is the requitall of euill paſt: We graunt that all ſatisfaction is directed againſt ſinne, and not againſt the perſon, but for the great good of the man, albeit that for a ſeaſon it may afflict, both his body and minde too, as Saint <hi>Paules</hi> former Epiſtle did the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, but this ſorrowe being according vnto God, doth much benefit the perſon, as the Apoſtle declareth. For beſides this reuenge taken on himſelfe to appeaſe Gods wrath, it breedeth (as it is in the text following) in our corrupt nature, that loueth not ſuch chaſtiſement, <hi>A feare to returne to ſinne,</hi> leaſt it be againe puniſhed, for where there is no feare of paynes, and much pleaſure, thither our corruption will runne headlong. It ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp alſo in vs, <hi>Indignation againſt ſinne,</hi> and all the wicked inſtruments of it, <hi>A defence and clearing of our ſelues,</hi> with the honeſter ſort, <hi>And an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and deſire to flie as farre from ſinne as other our equals, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>A loue of vertue and honeſt life,</hi> which freeth vs from that ſorrowe and all other troubleſome paſſions, all which are playnelie gathered out of the ſame text of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly ſayeth M. PERKINS. <hi>They make three workes of ſatisfaction, Prayer, Fasting, and Almeſdeedes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the first, it is meere fooliſhneſſe to thinke, that a man by prayer can ſatisfie for his ſinnes, it is all one as if you had ſaid, that a begger by asking an almes can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the almes, or a debtor, by requeſting his creditor to pardon his debt, ſhould thereby pay his debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Prayer doth appeaſe Gods juſtice, and obtayne pardon, God him ſelfe is witnes, ſaying. <hi>Call vpon mee in the day of tribulation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.</note> 
                        <hi>and I will deliuer thee.</hi> Prayer cannot be made without faith in Gods power, &amp; hope in his goodnes, and therefore muſt needes be pleaſing in Gods ſight: by prayer we humble our ſelues before God, and acknowledge his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and our infirmity. By prayer we lament with bitter teares our owne ingratitude, folly and wickednes, and bewayle the grieuouſnes of our ſinnes: ſuch prayer made King <hi>Dauid</hi> (as his Pſalmes doe teſtefie) water his couch with teares, making them his foode day and night: and by them he ſatisfied for his former offences. So did a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinner then he, King <hi>Manaſſes:</hi> who falling into tribulition,<note place="margin">2. Paral. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>prayed vnto the Lord his God, and did great penance before the God of his fathers, and prayed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21661:68"/> and entreated earneſtly, and God heard his prayers, and brought him backe againe to Ieruſalem into his Kingdome.</hi> Now to M. PERKINS <hi>Similes.</hi> A begger doth not deſerue his almes, becauſe he makes not this former kinde of prayer, but the ſhort ſleight one of the Proteſtants from the lippes outward: The like we ſay of a debter, whoſe creditor being a needie man, will not be paid without mony, but God who needes none of our goodes, highly eſteemeth of an humble and contrite hart, grieued much for hauing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſight of God, and humbly ſuing vnto him for pardon. To ſuch a one he ſaid.<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Did I not forgiue thee all thy debt, becauſe thou beſoughteſt me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſaith M. PERKINS. <hi>Faſting is a thing indifferent, of the ſame nature with eating, and drinking, no more conferring to the Kingdome of heauen, then eating, and drinking doth.</hi> What an Epicurian, and fleſhlie Doctrine is this? Why then did the Niniuites faſt, put on ſack-cloath, and lie on the ground (all which bodely afflictions are reduced to faſting) rather then eate, and drinke, and preſume of Gods mercy, if the one had beene as acceptable to God as the other? Why is S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> commended for his rough gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and thinne diet, if cheariſhing the fleſh pleaſe God as well, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of it?<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> Chriſt ſaith expreſſely. <hi>That if we faſt in ſecret, his heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will repay vs openly:</hi> Will he reward eating, and drinking ſo liberally? but of faſting we ſhall haue a whole Chapter hereafter. Therefore briefly I here conclude, that this Doctrine tendeth to the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdome of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Epicures,</hi> whoſe ſweete ſpeech is. <hi>Let vs eate, and let vs drinke, for after death there is no pleaſure.</hi> True: for ſuch Belly-gods and their followers.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly he ſaith, that Almeſdeedes cannot be workes of ſatisfaction for ſinnes. For when we giue them as we ought, we doe but our dutie, and we may aſwell ſay, that a man by paying one debt, may diſcharge an other, as to ſay by doeing his dutie, he may ſatisfie Gods juſtice for the puniſhment or his ſinnes. A man might ſuppoſe, that this man were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely well ſeene in <hi>Carolo Buffone,</hi> that thus ruffleth in graue matters with his ſimple <hi>Similes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Almeſdeedes redeeme our ſinnes, purge vs from them, and make all thinges cleane vnto vs, hath beene already proued out of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, I will joyne thereunto this one teſtimonie of that worthy Martir S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Serm. de opere &amp; cleemoſ.</note> 
                        <hi>Our frailty could not tell what to doe, vnleſſe the goodnes of God, by teaching vs the workes of iustice and mercy, had ſhewed vs a certayne way of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our ſaluation, which is, that with Almeſdeedes we might waſh cleane away the filth of ſinnes, which we had contracted after Baptiſme.</hi> The holy Ghoſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the Scripture, and ſaith. <hi>Sinnes are purged by almeſdeedes and faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to M. PERKINS <hi>Simile.</hi> We deny that a man is bound to giue all the almes that he can: We are bound to giue that which we may well
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21661:68"/> ſpare, when there is great want: But almes (which is a part of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) is not giuen out of our ſuperfluity, but ſpared from our neceſſary vſes. And is many times beſtowed, when there is no ſuch great neede, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on building Schooles, Colledges, Hoſpitals, and Chappels. And this may ſerue to anſwere M. PERKINS <hi>Similes</hi> againſt theſe three workes of ſatisfaction: If any man deſire to knowe why we make ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of theſe three workes, it is principally for two cauſes: Firſt, we being to ſatisfie, muſt performe it with ſuch thinges, as be our owne, which be of three ſortes, either they belong to our ſoule, or to our body, or to our externall goodes, the goodes of our minde, we offer to God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by faſting, and other reaſonable bodely diſcipline, we exhibite vnto him, <hi>A liuing hoaſte, holy and pleaſing God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> By Almeſdeedes we make him an agreeable preſent of our goodes. Secondly, all ſinne as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth,<note place="margin">1. Epiſ 2.</note> may be reduced to three principall heades. <hi>The concupiſcence of the fleſh:</hi> that is Leachery, which is cooled by faſting and ſuch like afflicting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; <hi>Concupiſcence of the eyes,</hi> Couetouſnes, which is purged and chaſed away by almeſdeedes: <hi>And pride of life,</hi> which is ſuppreſſed by humble prayer, and often meditation of our owne miſeries.</p>
                     <p>But now to knitte vp this queſtion. Let vs heare briefly what the beſt learned, and pureſt antiquity hath taught of this ſatisfaction done by man, and becauſe M. PERKINS beganne with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> omitting his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. Let vs firſt heare what he ſaith of it in his booke of penance. <hi>How fooliſh is it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not to fulfill our penance, and yet to expect pardon of our ſinnes, this is not to tender the price, and yet to put out a hand for the reward: for God hath decreede to ſet the pardon at this price: he propoſeth impunity to be redeemed with this recompence of penance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His equall in ſtanding, and better in learning <hi>Origen,</hi> thus diſcourſeth. <hi>See our good Lord tempering mercy with ſeuerity,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hom. 3. in lib. iudic.</note> 
                        <hi>and weighing the meaſure of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in a iuſt and mercifull balance: he deliuereth not vp a ſinner for euer. But looke how long time thou knoweſt thy ſelfe to haue offended, ſo long doe thou humble thy ſelfe to God, and ſatisfie him in the confeſſion of penance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That glorious Martir, and moſt learned Arch-Biſhop S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is wonderfull vehement againſt them, that would not haue ſeuere penance done, by ſuch as fell in perſecution, ſaying. <hi>That ſuch indiſcreet men, labour tooth and nayle, that ſatisfaction be not done to God, highly offended againſt them.</hi> And ſaith further, <hi>That he who withdraweth our brethren from theſe workes of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, doth miſerably deceiue them, cauſing them that might doe true penance, and ſatisfie God their mercifull Father, with their prayer and workes, to periſh daylie.</hi>

Hitherto we agree (but not in this which he interlaceth) that in the ſtate of Nature, euery man was inſtructed of God immediatly in both matters of faith and religion: For that God then as euer ſince vſed the miniſterie aſwel of good fathers, as godly maſters; as ENOCH, NOE, ABRAHAM, and ſuch like, to teach their children and ſeruants the true worſhip of God, &amp; true faith in him; otherwiſe, how ſhould the word of God paſſe by Tradition fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ADAM to MOSES, as M.

(mary with theſe foure caueats) Firſt, that it preſcribe nothing childiſh or abſurd: See what a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21661:71"/> reuerent opinion this man carryeth of the Church of God, gouerned by his holy ſpirit, that it neuertheleſſe may preſcribe things both childiſh &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde.

Secondly, that it be not impoſed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie part of Gods worſhip: This is contrarie to the concluſion, for order and comelineſſe to be vſed in Gods worſhip, which the Church can preſcribe, is ſome part of the worſhip. Thirdly, that it be ſeuered from ſuperſtition, &amp;c. This is needeleſſe; for if it be not abſurd, which was the firſt prouiſo, it is alreadie ſeuered from ſuperſtition.

                     <p>Before wee come to the Proteſtants reaſons againſt Traditions; obſerue that we deuide Traditions into three ſorts: The firſt we tearmed <hi>Diuine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were deliuered by our bleſſed Sauiour, who is God: The ſecond, <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> as deliuered by the holy Apoſtles: The third, <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and deliuered by the Gouernours of the Church, after the Apoſtles daies.

Likewiſe aſmuch honor &amp; credit do we giue vnto the Apoſtles doctrine vnwritten, as writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For incke &amp; paper brought no new holines, nor gaue any force and vertue vnto either Gods on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words; but they were of the ſame value and credit vttered by word of mouth, as if they had bene written. Here the queſtion is principally of diuine Traditions, which we hold to be neceſſarie to ſaluation, to reſolue &amp; determine many matters of greater difficultie. For we deny not but that ſome ſuch principall poynts of our Faith, (which the ſimple are bounde to beleeue vnder paine of damnation) may bee gathered out of the holie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21661:71"/> Scriptures: as for example; that God is the Creator of the world, Chriſt the Redeemer of the world, the Holy Ghoſt the Sanctifier: and other ſuch like Articles of the Creede, M.

If it be ſaide, that this is ſpoken as well of the vn-written as written worde; for there is no mention in the texte of the written worde: then M.

Shall we thinke that none of the Prophets that liued and wrote many volumes after this, had not read theſe words; or that they either vnderſtood them not; or that vnderſtanding them well, did wilfullie tranſgreſſe againſt them? one of theſe the Proteſtants muſt needes defend, or elſe for very ſhame ſurceaſe the alleadging of this text for the all-ſufficiencie of the written word.</p>

                     <p>S.

                     <p>Now wee muſt looke vnto this Gentle-mans ſingers: There were three corruptions in the text of S. IOHN: here is one, but it is a ſoule one. In ſteed of Preaching vnto them <hi>an other Goſpell,</hi> he puts (preach vnto them <hi>any other thing:</hi>) when there is great difference betweene an other Goſpell, &amp; any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. The Goſpel comprehendeth the principal poynts of faith, &amp; the whole worke of Gods building in vs: which S. PAVL like a wiſe Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect<note n="*" place="margin">1.

So that, that falcification of the text is intollerable; and yet when all is done, nothing can be wringed out of it, to prooue the written word to comprehend all doctrine needefull to ſaluation: for S. PAVL ſpeaketh there onely of his Goſpell, that is, of his preaching vnto the Galathians, and not one worde of any written Goſpel: No more doth he in that place to TIMOTHY: And ſo it is nothing to purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>This text of holy Scripture, is ſo farre from yeelding our aduerſaries two Arguments, that it affoordeth not ſo much as any probable colour of halfe one good argument. In ſearching out the true ſence of holy Scriptures; wee muſt obſerue diligently the nature &amp; proper ſignifycation of the words; as M. P. alſo noteth out of S. AVGVSTINE, in his ſixt objection of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; which, if the Proteſtants did here performe, they would make no ſuch account of this text: for S. PAVL ſaith, only that all Scripture is <hi>profitable,</hi> not <hi>ſufficient,</hi> to teach, to reproue, &amp;c. How are they then carried away with their owne partiall affections: that cannot diſcerne betweene <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>ſufficient.</hi> Good Timber is profitable to the buylding of an houſe, but it is not ſufficient, without ſtones, morter, &amp; a Carpenter. Seede ſerues well, yea, is alſo neceſſarie to bring forth corne: but will it ſuffice of it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manuring of the ground, and ſeaſonable weather? And to fit our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe more properlie; good lawes are verie profitable: yea, moſt expedient for the good gouernment of the common-wealth: But are they ſufficient without good cuſtomes, good gouernours, and judges, to ſee the ſame Laws &amp; cuſtoms rightly vnderſtood and duely executed? Euen ſo the holy Scripturs (S. PAVL affirmeth) are very profitable; as contayning very good &amp; neceſſary matter, both to teach, reproue, &amp; correct: but he ſaith, not they are ſufficient, or that they do containe all doctrine needfull for theſe foure ends: And therefore, to argue out of S. PAVL, that they are ſufficient for all thoſe purpoſes; when he ſaieth onely, that they are profitable to them, is plainely not to know, or not to care what a man ſaith: And to preſſe ſuch an impertinent cauil, ſo often and ſo vehemently as the Proteſtants do, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but to bewray (vnto the indifferent reader) either their extreame ignorance, or moſt audacious impudencie, that thinke they can face out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter, be it neuer ſo impertinent. The ſame anſwere I make vnto M. P. his ſecond argument, out of the ſame place: that the holy Scriptures bee profitable to make the man of God abſolute, but not ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>I ſay more-ouer; that M. P. doth falſely Engliſh theſe words <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> into the whole Scriptures: when it ſignifyeth all Scripture, that is, euerie booke of Scripture: and is there put to verifie, that the Old Teſtament only ſerues to inſtruct to ſaluation: For, in the words next before, S. PAVL ſheweth, how that TIMOTHY from his infancie, had bene trayned vp in the knowledge of the holy Scriptures: which, ſaith he, can inſtruct thee to ſaluation: And annexeth, as the confirmation thereof the Text cited: <hi>All Scripture inſpired of God, is profitable to teach, &amp;c.</hi> Now, in TIMOTHYS in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21661:73"/> no parte of the New Teſtament was written, and therefore, all Scripture which is here put, to prooue that Scripture which TIMOTHY in his Infancie knew; cannot but by vnreaſonable wreſting, ſignifie more than all the bookes of the Olde Teſtament. So that there are three ſoule faultes in this the Proteſtants Achilles: The firſt, in falſification of the text, that it might ſeeme to bee ſpoken of the whole, which is ſpoken of euerie part. The ſecond, in applying that which is ſpoken of the Olde Teſtament, vnto both the Olde and New. The third, in making that to be all-ſufficient which S. PAVL affirmeth onely to be profitable. And this is all they can ſaye out of the Scripture, to prooue that the written worde containes all doctrine needefull to ſaluation: Where-upon, I make this invincible argument againſt them out of this their owne poſition.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is neceſſarie to be beleeued, but that which is written in holy Scripture. But in no place of Scripture is it written, that the written worde containes all doctrine needefull to ſaluation, as hath bene prooued.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, it is not neceſſarie to ſaluation to beleeue the written worde, to containe all doctrine needefull to ſaluation. And by the ſame principle, I might reject all teſtimonie of Antiquitie as needeleſſe, if the Scriptures be ſo al-ſufficient as they hold. Yet let vs here what teſtimonie M.

                     <p>I thinke that there is no ſuch ſentence to be found in him; he ſaies by way of objection: <hi>What neede we make recourſe vnto the authoritie of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall vnderſtanding, if the Canon of the Scripture be perfect?</hi> Hee affirmeth not that they be fullie ſufficient to determine all controuerſies in religion, but throughout all his booke he prooues the cleane contrarie, that no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie can be certainelie confuted and ſuppreſſed by only Scriptures, without we take with it the ſenſe and interpretation of the Catholike Church.</p>
                     <p>Thus M.

                     <p>Fiſt, for our Sauiour CHRIST IESVS, he out of his diuine wiſdome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered his doctrine moſt commonly in his owne name, <hi>(But I ſaye vnto you)</hi> And verie ſeldome confirmeth it with any teſtimonie out of the Law.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21661:75"/> The Euangeliſts do often note how CHRIST fulfilled the old prophecies; but neuer, or very ſeldome ſeeke to confirme his doctrine by teſtimonies: their owne they doe ſometimes; but to ſaye they neuer wrote any thinge out of Tradition, proceedes of moſt groſſe ignorance. Where had Saint MATHEVV the adoring of the Sages? S. IOHN Baptiſts preaching? briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that was done before his owne conuerſion, but by Tradition? S. MARK wrote the moſt part of his Goſpell out of Tradition, receiued from S. PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, as witneſſeth EVSEBIVS,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. hiſt cap. 14.</note> S.

                        <hi>as he had receiued it by Tradition, from them who were eye-witneſſes.</hi> What deſperate careleſneſſe was it then to affirme that the Apoſtles neuer vſed Tradition, to confirme any doctrine? when ſome of them built, not onely parcels, but their whole Goſpels vpon Traditions. His other reaſon is; that if we beleeue vnwritten Traditions were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſaluation, then we muſt aſwell beleeue the writings of the auncient Fathers, as the writings of the Apoſtles: becauſe, Apoſtolicall Traditions are not elſe-where to be ſound, but in their bookes; but that were abſurde, for they might erre.</p>

                     <p>That doth not follow for three cauſes: Firſt, Apoſtolicall Traditions, are aſwel kept in the minde of the learned, as in the auncient Fathers writings: and therefore haue more credit than the Fathers writings. Secondly, they are commonly recorded of more than one of the Fathers, and ſo haue fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer teſtimonie than any one of their writings. Thirdly, if there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apoſtolical Tradition, related but of one auncient Father, yet it ſhould be of more credit than any other thing of his owne inuention, becauſe that was regiſtred by him, as a thing of more eſtimation. And againe, ſome of the reſt of thoſe bleſſed and godly perſonages, would haue reprooued it, as they did all other falſe-hoods, if it had not bene ſuch indeed as it was tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Which when they did not, they gaue a ſecrete approbation of it for ſuch; and ſo that hath the interpretatiue conſent at leaſt of the learned of that age, and the following for Apoſtolicall Tradition.</p>

For theſe and ſuch like, which were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21661:75"/> fore-tolde in holy writ: hee needed not to alleage any other proofe, but when hee was to perſwade them to abandon MOSES Lawe, he then deliuered to them the decrees of the Apoſtles, and taught them to keepe them:<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 16.</note> As alſo when hee inſtructed the Corinthians in the Sacrament of the Altar, he beginneth with Tradition, ſaying:<note n="*" place="margin">1.

                     <p>Secondlie, is it not plaine dotage, to auouch that this ſeconde Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, was the firſt that euer hee wrote?

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21661:76"/> man leaue to dreame ſome-times. To the poynt of the anſwere, that all was written after in ſome other of his Epiſtles, which before had bene deliuered by word of mouth. How prooueth M. P. that? the man hath ſuch confidence in his owne worde, that hee goeth not once about to prooue it. Good Sir, hold you not here; that nothing is needefull to be beleeued, which is not written in the word? Shew vs then where it is written in the word, that Saint PAVL wrote in his later Epiſtles, that which he taught by word of mouth before? or elſe by your owne rule it is not needefull to beleeue it. But yet for a more full ſatisfaction of the indifferent reader, I will ſet downe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of ſome of the auncienteſt and beſt Interpreters of this place of the Apoſtle, that we may ſee whether they thought that S. PAVL committed all to writing, and left nothing by Tradition.</p>
                     <p>S.

                     <p>S.

                     </p>
                     <p>S. IOHN DAMASCEN accordeth with the former ſaying,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 4. De fide cap. 17</note> 
                        <hi>That the Apoſtles deliuered many things without writing.</hi> S. PAVL doth teſtifie, when he writeth, <hi>Therefore brethren ſtand and hold the Traditions which haue bene taught you either by word of mouth or by Epiſtle.</hi> Theſe holy and judicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors of S. PAVL, free from all partialitie, gather out of this text of his, that many things neceſſarie to be beleeued, euen vntil their daies remained vnwritten, and were religiouſlie obſerued by Tradition; which throweth flat to the ground M. P. his falſe ſuppoſition (fenced with neither reaſon nor authotie) that S. PAVL put in writing afterward all that he had firſt taught by word of mouth.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer S. PAVL immediatly before his death in one of the laſt of his Epiſtles, commandeth his deare diſciple TIMOTHY,<note n="*" place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>To commend vnto the faithfull, that which he heard of him by many witneſſes;</hi> &amp; not that only which he ſhould finde written in ſome of his Epiſtles, or in the written Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Argument for Traditions, is this, to beleeue that there be ſo many bookes of holy Scripture, and no more: and that thoſe be they which are commonly taken ſo to be, is very neceſſarie to ſaluation; now this is not to be found written in any place of holy Scripture, but is receiued onely by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21661:76"/> Tradition, wherefore it is neceſſarie to ſaluation to beleeue ſome Tradition. M. P. anſwereth that the bookes of the Old and New Teſtament, be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not beleeued on bare Tradition, but by the bookes themſelues on this maner. Let the man who is indued with the ſpirit of diſcerning, reade the bookes and conſider firſt the Author of them, who is God; then the matter contained, which is diuine; the maner of ſpeech, which is full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie in ſimple words: Laſtly, the end aymed at, which is Gods honor, and by this meanes he ſhall diſcerne any parte of Scripture from the writings of men whatſoeuer.</p>

                     <p>A Wiſe and deepe obſeruation I warrant you, and well-worthy a graue Author: Let vs examine it briefely; firſt he wil haue his man endued with the ſpirit of diſcerning: Who ſhall endue him with that ſpirit? M. P. ſeemeth to ſay, that euery Sheepe of Chriſt hath his ſpirite. But S. PAVL<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 12</note> teacheth plainely the contrarie; that ſome certaine onely haue the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſcerne. And touching this matter of diſcerning which bookes are Canonicall, which are not: Not the learnedſt in the Primitiue Church would take vpon him to diſcerne which they were, three hundred yeeres after CHRIST, was left vndefined by the beſt learned, whether the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Epiſtles of S. IAMES and IVDE: the ſecond of S. PETER: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third of S.

Who more proſound, more skilfull to diſcerne, than that ſubtile and ſharpe Doctor S. AVGVSTINE, and yet the Proteſtants wil not allow him the true ſpirit of diſcerning which bookes be Canonicall. For he, in diuers places of his workes,<note n="*" place="margin">De doct Chriſt. c. 8 18. de ciui dei 36. lib. cont. ep. gaudent. 2</note> holdeth the bookes of the Machabees, to be Canonical Scriptures; and expreſſely prooueth the booke of Wiſdome ſo to be.<note n="*" place="margin">De prae deſt.

                     <p>His ſecond is, that he who goeth about to diſcerne whether the booke be Canonicall or no, muſt conſider the Author, who is God. If he muſt at the firſt take God to be the Author of the booke, what needes any further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? It muſt needes be Canonicall that hath God for the Author. This mans wits were ſurelie from home, when he diſcourſed thus; and therefore it ſhould be but follie to ſtand vpon his particularities; let this one reaſon in generall ſerue to confute him: all this maner put together, ſerueth onely to helpe particuler men to diſcerne which bookes are Canonicall, who may eaſely after their diligent inquirie erre and be deceiued in this poynt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery man is a lyar.<note n="*" place="margin">Rom.</note> And if there be no more certain means to aſſure

A goodly mockerie: Men were not ſo taught in the Primitiue Church, but the moſt skilfull and wiſeſt in diſcerning Canonicall bookes, truſted not vnto their owne judgement, but learned alwaies vpon Apoſtolicall Traditions. So did CERAPION an auncient holy writer (as EVSEBIVS reporteth) reject certaine bookes ſet out in the Apoſtles names, becauſe they had not receiued from their Predeceſſors any ſuch.

So doth he deliuer his opinion of the foure Euangeliſtes, and other bookes of Canonicall Scripture, and not relying on his owne wit, which was excellent, or learning which was ſinguler in all manner of languages and matters: That S. AVGVSTINE was of the ſame minde, may bee gathered out of theſe wordes of his,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 35 cap. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Contra Fauſtum.</hi> Of what booke can there be any aſſurance, if the letters, which the Church propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the Apoſtles, and by ſuch excellencie declared throughout all Nations, doeth teach and holde to be the Apoſtles, ſhould be vncertaine, whither they be the Apoſtles or no. So that hee maketh the declaration of the Church deſcended of the Apoſtles, to be a ſure pillar to reſt vpon, for the certaine knowledge of Canonicall Scripture and other ſpirits whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, if they follow not that rule to be rejected; ſo far is he off from encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euerie ſheepe of Chriſts ſold, to take that weightie matter vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as M. P. doth. And what can be more againſt the moſt prudent proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the diuine wiſedome, than to permit euery one to be a judge of the bookes of Canonicall Scripture. For if all thoſe bookes, and no others ſhould paſſe currant for Canonicall, (which any Chriſtian taking vpon him the ſpirit of diſcerning, would cenſure to be ſuch) then awaie with all the Olde Teſtament, becauſe diuers eſteemed it to proceed of ſome euill ſpirites, as witneſſes <hi>Freueus</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21661:77"/> haue had but one of the ſoure Goſpells, ſome fiue, ſome ſixe, ſome ſeauen; ſome rejected all S. PAVLS Epiſtles: Many, and thoſe of the faithfull did not admit for Canonicall ſome of the other Apoſtles Epiſtles, nor the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. If then the diuine ſore-ſight of our Sauiour had not preuented this moſt ſoule inconueniencie by inſtituting a more certaine meanes of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and declaring which bookes were penned by inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt: which not then by leauing it vnto euery mans diſcretion, he might be thought to haue had but ſlender care of our ſaluation, which euey true Chriſtian hart doth abhorre to thinke: and therefore we muſt needes admit of this moſt holy and prouident Tradition of them from hand to hand: as among the Proteſtants <hi>Brentius</hi> doth in his <hi>Prologemenis,</hi> &amp; alſo <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> handling the ſecond kinde of Traditions, in his examination of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent;</hi> albeit they reject all other Traditions, beſides this one.</p>
                     <p>The two next arguments for Traditions, bee not well propounded by M. P. The third is to be framed thus:</p>
                     <p>Either all the bookes of holy Scripture conteine all needfull doctrine to ſaluation, or ſome certaine of them without the reſt; not ſome of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſt, for then the other ſhould be ſuperſluous, which no man hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: therefore all the bookes of holy Scripture put together, do contayne all neceſſary inſtruction. Now then the argument followeth, but ſome of thoſe bookes of holy Scripture haue bene loſt; therefore, ſome poynts of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie doctrine contayned in them, are not extant in the written worde, and conſequently to be learned by Tradition. M. P. anſwereth: Firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſome of the bookes to be loſt, that all needfull doctrine, which was in them, is in ſome of the others preſerued. But why did he not ſolue the Argument propoſed? were then thoſe bookes ſuperſluous? Doth the Holie Ghoſt ſet men to pen needeleſſe diſcourſes? which this anſwere ſuppoſeth: Therefore he giues a ſecond more ſhamefull, that none be periſhed, which is moſt contrary vnto the plaine Scriptures:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Paral. vlt. 2. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. 9.</note> as S. IOHN CHRYSOSTOM prooueth:<note n="*" place="margin">Hom. 9. in Mat. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now as for M. P. geſſes, that ſome of them are yet extant, but otherwiſe called: ſome were but little rolles of Paper; ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and of Philoſophie, I holde them not worth the diſcuſsing, beeing not much pertinent, and avowed one in word onely, without either any reaſon or authoritie.</p>
                     <p>M. P. His fourth objection of the Jewiſh <hi>Cabala,</hi> is a meere dreame of his owne: our Argument is this; MOSES who was the Pen-man of the Olde Law, committed not all to writing, but deliuered certaine poynts needefull to ſaluation by Tradition, nor any Law-maker that euer was in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21661:78"/> comprehended al in letters, but eſtabliſhed many things by cuſtomes, therefore not likelie that our Chriſtian law ſhould be all written.</p>
                     <p>That MOSES did not pen all, thus we prooue. It was as neceſſarie for women to be deliuered from Originall ſinne as men. Circumciſion the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for men, could not poſsible be applyed to women, as euery one who knoweth what circumciſion is can tell; neither is there any other remedie prouided in the written law, to deliuer women from that ſinne: Therefore ſome other remedie for them was deliuered by Tradition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> if the Childe were likely to die, before the eight daie, there was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for them, as the moſt learned doe hold, yet no where written in the Law: Alſo, many Gentils, during that ſtate of the Old Teſtament, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as IOB, and many ſuch like, according to the opinion of all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers: yet in the Law, or any other part of the Old Teſtament, it is not written, what they had to beleeue, or how they ſhould liue: wherefore, many things needefull to ſaluation, were then deliuered by Tradition.</p>
                     <p>To that reaſon of his; that God in his prouidence ſhould not permit ſuch a loſſe of any parte of the Scripture: I anſwere, that God permitteth much euill: Againe, no great loſſe in that, according to our opinion, who hold that Tradition might preſerue what was then loſt.

                     <p>And to ſpecifie for example ſake, ſome two or three poynts of greateſt importance; where is it written that our Sauiour, the Sonne of God, is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, of the ſame ſubſtance with his father? Where is it written, that the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Sonne, aſwell as from the Father? Where is it written, that there is a Trinitie, that is three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reallie diſtincte in one, and the very ſame ſubſtance? And that there is in our Sauiour CHRIST IESVS, no perſon of man, but the ſubſtance of God &amp; man, ſubſiſting in the ſecond perſon of the Trinitie: Be not all and euerie of theſe principall articles of the Chriſtian faith, and moſt neceſſarie to be beleeued of the learned, and yet not one of them in expreſſe tearmes written in any parte of the holie Bible. Wherefore wee muſt either admit Traditions, or leaue the higheſt myſteries of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, vnto the diſcretion and courteſie of euerie wrangler, as ſhalbe more declared in the argument following.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt and laſt reaſon for Traditions: Sundrie places of holy Scriptures be hard to be vnderſtood, others doubtfull whether they muſt be taken liberally or figuratiuely: If then it be put to euery Chriſtian to take his owne expoſition, euery ſeueral ſect, will coyne interpretations in fauour of their own opinions: &amp; ſo ſhal the word of God, ordayned only to teach vs the trueth, be abuſed and made an Inſtrument to confirme all errors. To auoide which inconuenience, conſiderate men haue recourſe vnto the Traditions and auncient Records of the Primitiue Church, receiued from the Apoſtles, and deliuered to the poſteritie, as the true copies of Gods word; ſee the true Expoſition and ſenſe of it, and thereby confute and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all priuate and new gloſſes, which agree not with thoſe auncient and holy Comentaries: So that for the vnderſtanding of both difficult and doubtfull texts of Scripture, Traditions are moſt neceſſarie,</p>
                     <p>M. P. His anſwere is, that there is no ſuch neede of them, but in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full places, the Scripture it ſelfe is the beſt gloſſe: If there be obſerued; firſt the analogie of faith, which is the ſumme of religion, gathered out of the cleereſt places. Secondly, the circumſtance of the place, and the nature and ſignifycation of the wordes. Thirdly, the conference of place with place; and concludeth, that the Scripture is falſely tearmed the matter of ſtrife, it being not ſo of it ſelfe, but by the abuſe of man.</p>

                     <head>REPLIE.</head>
                     <p>To begin with his latter words, becauſe I muſt ſtand vpon the former: Is the Scripture falſely tearmed matter of ſtrife, becauſe it is not ſo, of his owne nature? why then, is CHRIST truely called the ſtone of offence or no, to them that beleeue not? S. PETER ſayeth, Yes,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> No ſayeth M. P.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21661:79"/> becauſe that commeth not of Chriſt, but of themſelues. But good Sir. Chriſt is truely tearmed a ſtone of offence, and the Scripture, matter of ſtrife, albeit there be no cauſe in them of thoſe faults, but becauſe it ſo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out by the malice of men.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is not wherefore it is ſo called, but whether it be ſo called or no truely: That which truely is, may bee ſo called truely: But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truely is matter of great contention, euery obſtinate Heretike vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them according to his owne fantaſie, and therefore may truely be ſo tearmed, although it bee not the cauſe of contention in it ſelfe, but written to take away all contention.</p>
                     <p>But to the capitall matter; theſe three rules gathered out of Saint AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVSTINE, be good directions, whereby ſober and ſound wits may much profite in ſtudie of diuinitie, if they neglect not other ordinarie helpes of good inſtructiors, and learned Comentaries: But to affirme that euerie Chriſtian may by theſe meanes be inabled to iudge which is the true ſenſe of any doubtfull or hard text is extreame raſhneſſe and meere folly. S. AVGVSTINE himſelfe well conuerſant in theſe rules, indued with a moſt happie wit, and yet much bettered with the excellent knowledge of all the liberall Sciences; yet he hauing moſt diligently ſtudied the Holie Scriptures, for more than thirtie yeares, with the helpe alſo of the beſt Comentaries he could get, and counſell of the moſt excuſit; yet he ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie confeſſeth, <hi>That there were more places of Scripture, that after all his ſtudie, he vnderſtood not, then which he did vnderſtand,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. 119. cap. 21.</note> And ſhall euery ſimple man furniſhed only with <hi>M. P.</hi> his three rules of not twiſe three lynes be able to diſſolue any difficultie in them whatſoeuer. Why doe the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (to omit all former Heretiks) vnderſtand them in one ſort, the <hi>Calueniſts</hi> after an other, The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> a third way, and ſo of other ſects.</p>
                     <p>And in our owne Countrey, how commeth it to paſſe that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants finde one thing in the holy Scriptures, the Puritans almoſt the cleane contrarie? Why I ſay is there ſo great, bitter, and endleſſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among brothers of the ſame ſpirit, about the ſenſe and meaning of Gods word: If euery one might, by the aide of thoſe triuiall notes, readily diſcloſe all difficulties, and aſſuredly boult out the certaine trueth of them; It cannot be but moſt euident to men of any iudgement, that the Scripture it ſelfe can neuer end any doubtful controuerſie, without there be admitted ſome certaine Iudge to declare what is the true meaning of it. And it cannot but redound to the diſhonour of our bleſſed Sauiour to ſay, that he hath left a matter of ſuch importance at randome, and hath not prouided for his ſeruants an aſſured meane to attaine to the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21661:79"/> of it. If in matters of Temporal juſtice it ſhould be permitted to euery contentious ſmatterer in the Lawe, to expound and conſter the groundes of the Lawe and ſtatutes, as it ſhould ſeeme fitteſt in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and not be bounde to ſtande to the ſentence and declaration of the Iudge, what iniquitie ſhould not be Lawe, or when ſhould there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ende of any hard matter; one Lawyer defending one part, an other the other: One counſeller aſſuring on his certaine knowledge, one partie to haue the right, an other, as certainely auerring, not that, but the contrarie to be Law, both alleadging for their warrant ſome texts of Law: What end and pacification of the parties could be deuiſed, vnleſſe the deciſion of the controuerſie be committed vnto the definitiue ſentence of ſome, who ſhould declare whether counſellor had argued juſtly and according to the true meaning of the Lawe: none at all, but bloudy debate and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conflict, each perſuing to get or keepe by force of armes, that which his learned counſell auouched to be his owne.</p>
                     <p>To auoyde then ſuch garboyles and inteſtiue contention, there was neuer yet any Law-maker ſo ſimple, but appoynted ſome gouernour and Iudge, who ſhould ſee the due obſeruation of his Lawes, and determine all doubts that might ariſe about the letter and expoſition of the Law, who is therefore called the quicke and liuely lawe; and ſhall we Chriſtians thinke that our diuine Law-maker, who in wiſdome, care, and prouidence, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all others, more than the heauens do the earth, hath left his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lawes at randome, to be interpreted as it ſhould ſeeme beſt vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one pretending ſome hidden knowledge from we know not what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: no no, It cannot be once imagined without too too great derogation vnto the ſoueraigne prudence of the Sonne of God.</p>
                     <p>In the Olde Teſtament, which was but a ſtate of bondage, and as it were an introduction to the Newe, yet was there one appoynted vnto whome they were commanded to repaire for the reſolution of all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſes concerning the Lawe: yea, and bound (were they vnder paine of death) to ſtande to his determination; and ſhall wee bee ſo ſimple as to ſuffer our ſelues to bee perſwaded, that in the glorious ſtate of the Goſpell, plotted and framed by the wiſdome of God himſelfe, worſe order ſhould bee taken for this high poynte of the true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Holy Goſpel it ſelf, being the life and ſoule of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Giue mee leaue gentle Reader, to ſtay ſome-what longer in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe there is nothing of more importance, and it is not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led any where elſe in all this Booke.

All which abſurdities, neceſſarily followe of M. P. his definition, and be things vnheard of either in holy Scriptures, or among the auncient Holy Fathers, proceeding onely out of the droſſe of their owne deuiſes: and therefore, with as great facilitie to be denyed of vs, as they doe with audacitie auouch them. To make vp then the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt adde, that the promiſe to God be of ſome better good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from our owne free choyſe and libertie: ſo that no Vowe is made without a mans free choyſe to bynde himſelfe, ouer and beſides all other neceſſarie bondes: which to bee of, the nature of a Vowe wee gather firſt out of holie Scriptures.<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 23</note>

                     <p>What can be more cleare, then that a man may chooſe whether he will Vowe or no?<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 7</note> which is confirmed in S. PAVL: <hi>He that decreeth in his hart, not hauing neceſsitie, but hauing power ouer his owne will, &amp;c.</hi> So that this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to promiſe, or not to promiſe, is of the ſubſtance of a Vowe, and that if he liſt not to Vowe, he doeth not ſinne: which were verie falſe, if the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of neceſſarie dueties were Vowes. For hee that refuſeth to accepte them, doeth ſinne: as if a man ſhould refuſe to performe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods commandementes. Hence it followeth moſte manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the promiſe which we make to God in Baptiſme, of keeping Gods commandements, is no Vowe, if a Vowe be taken properly: becauſe it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in vs to refuſe it, without we will withall, refuſe the grace of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and remaine in the ſtate of damnation. And M. P. affirming it to be a Vowe; and often repeating it, doth not once confirme it with any ſhadow of proofe, but takes that for granted, which he knowes we do deny flatlie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond poynt of our ſuppoſed conſent is, that Vowes were ſome part of Gods worſhip in MOSES Law, but are not ſo in the Goſpel, which we alſo denie, M. P. prooues his aſſertion thus. Vowes belonged to the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of MOSES Lawe, but all thoſe Ceremonies are aboliſhed, by Chriſts Paſsion.</p>

                     <p>That Vowes in themſelues were no part of the Ceremonies of MOSES Law, but true parts of the worſhip of God in all eſtates; aſwell in the ſtate of Nature and the Goſpel, as in MOSES Law: but this poynt M. P. hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth againe in the firſt poynt of our difference, where it ſhall be diſcuſſed. Thirdly hee ſaith, that ſpeciall Vowes may be made in the New law, to performe ſome bodily exerciſe for ſome good ende, as to faſt, to taske our ſelues to prayer, or ſtudie of holy Scripture, and ſuch like: but many rules muſt then be obſerued: that we Vowe an honeſt thing agreeable to Gods word: this we allowe. Secondly, that it be ſo made, that it may ſtand with Chriſtian libertie: that is, that it make not ſuch thinges neceſſarie in conſcience, which Chriſtian religion leaues at libertie: This rule of his is flat repugnant to the nature of a Vowe, &amp; contrarie to himſelf. For he ſaith a little before; that a Chriſtian may Vowe Faſting, Prayer, almes-deedes. I then demaunde, hauing Vowed theſe things; is he not bounde to performe them? Yes, or elſe hee breakes his Vowe, with which God is highlie diſpleaſed.<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 23</note>

                     <p>What, is not your Holie-day ſeruice (which you call diuine ſeruice) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of Gods worſhip in your owne opinions? Can a publike aſſembly inſtituted to honor God by prayer and thankſgiuing? with externall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of time, place, apparrell, kneeling, ſtanding and ſitting, be no parte of Gods worſhip? In your irreligious Congregations, aſſembled together againſt CHRIST and his Catholike Church, be it ſo. But admitting as you do, your ſeruice to be good; it could not truely be denyed to be long vnto the worſhip of God. But to the matter of difference, you grow very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in your reports of our doctrine: for we hold that neither in the Olde nor New law, any man is bounde to Vowe, but that it is and euer was a councell, and no commandement, neuertheleſſe, a thing of great deuotion and perfection in both ſtates, intrinſecallie belonging and much further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true worſhippe of almightie God, which wee prooue in this ſorte. In a Vowe are two thinges; the one is the good which is Vowed, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the naturall parte: as for example, Faſting, &amp;c. The other, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it ſelfe made to God, which is the forme; the materiall parts doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto their ſeueral vertues: but this promiſe and performance of it be ſubſtantiall parts of Gods worſhip. For by promiſing of any good thing vnto God, we acknowledge &amp; profeſſe that God is the ſoueraigne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, and taketh great pleaſure in all good purpoſes and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: therefore, to honour and worſhip him, wee make that good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe againe, In performing that good ſeruice of God, we teſtifie, that hee is moſt majeſticall, reuerend, and dreadfull. And conſequently, that all promiſes made to him, are to be accompliſhed moſt diligently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, wherein we honour and worſhip him, as contrariewiſe they doe much diſhonour him who breake with him, as if he were of no better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21661:83"/> then to be ſo deluded. This thing in it ſelfe is ſo certaine and cleere, that he who denyes it, muſt needes either be ignorant in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Vowe, or not know wherein the true worſhip of God conſiſteth: for according vnto the holy Scriptures it ſelfe, all good deeds done to the glorie of God, be acts of the true worſhip of God. And S. ANNE<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 1</note> did <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, by faſting and prayer:</hi> And<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> almes beſtowed on Gods priſoners, is called <hi>a ſacrifice pleaſing and acceptable to God:</hi> And it is ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">Iac. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>to be a pure religion before God, to viſite Orphanes and widdowes:</hi> If then all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous duties done to the glorie of God, be parts of his true worſhip; much more Vowes, which by ſpecial promiſe dedicate a good deed to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: they then being of their own nature, ſpecial parts of his true worſhip of God: it followeth neceſſarie, that at all times they were and may be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the true worſhip of God: that they were in practiſe before MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES Law is euident, by that Vowe which IACOB made<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 28.</note>, of ſetting vp a ſtone, which ſhould be called the houſe of God, and of paying the tenthes of all his goodes. Out of which Vowe, wee alſo gather, that God holdeth for agreeable, any kinde of good ſeruice offred vnto him out of our owne deuotion: albeit he hath not commaunded it, for no ſuch thing as IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COB there Vowed was commaunded him, but hee being well aſſured that it would bee well taken by God, which was offered of good will, to his greater honour, hee Vowed it, and is in holy Scripture commended for it.</p>
                     <p>Againe, that when S. PAVL<note n="*" place="margin">Coloſ. 2.</note> ſeemeth to diſalowe voluntarie worſhip, he muſt be vnderſtood to ſpeake either of irronious, or of friuolous and fooliſh things, promiſed to God, which do not properlie ſerue to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of his honour.</p>
                     <p>Now that Vowes ſhould bee frequented in the ſtate of the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the euidence of S.

P. anſwereth, firſt, that by ſuch ceremonial worſhip as then was in vſe, the Prophet doth expreſſe the ſpiritual worſhip of the Newe Teſtament. This expoſition is voluntarie and nothing proper: For what is more vilde and abſurde, than (to declare that Chriſtians ſhall make no Vowes) to ſay that they ſhall make Vowes, as though one contrarie were ſit or would ſerue to expreſſe the other. This expoſition being very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete, M. P. adjoyneth a ſecond, that in the New Teſtament, wee haue Vowes of Morall and Euangelicall duties, but ſuch are not any parte of Gods worſhippe: ſo that firſt you ſhall haue no Vowes at all: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the winde being changed, you ſhall haue them, but as no parts of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21661:83"/> Gods worſhip, as though Morrall and Euangelicall duties vndertaken and performed to Gods greater glorie be not the verie ſynewes and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his ſeruice and worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Againe ſayth <hi>M. P.</hi> they alleadge for Euangelicall Vowes:<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 75</note> 
                        <hi>Vow vnto God and paye it: M. P.</hi> his aunſwere is, that this bindes the Iewes, hee would haue you vnderſtande not the Chriſtians. Wee ſaye; that it is no commaundement to either of them, but an exhortation, aſwell to the one as to the other. Firſt, becauſe good Vowes doe tende to the greater glorie of God in all ſtates: (as hath bene prooued before) Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, for that the Prophet in the next verſe, yeelding the reaſon why wee muſt paye our Vowes, ſayeth, <hi>That hee vnto whome wee haue Vowed is terrible vnto the Kings of the earth;</hi> And therefore moſt likely that ſuch Vowes he ſpake of there, may be made of any ſort of men inhabiting the earth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the auncient Fathers take it to extende vnto vs Chriſtians, as well as vnto the Iewes; let one Saincte AVGVSTINE ſerue in his Comentarie vppon this Pſalme 75. <hi>Becauſe wee haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe thinges</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>peraduenture thou who wast willing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but nowe wilt not Vowe: but marke what the Pſalme ſaide vnto thee:</hi> It ſayeth not, <hi>Doe not Vowe, but Vowe and paye it: wilt thou not Vowe? Therefore wouldeſt haue Vowed, but not haue fulfilled it, naye rather doe both: Let the one bee of thine owne promiſe, the other ſhall be performed by the helpe of God:</hi> Hee then tooke theſe wordes to belong vnto his Auditours who were no Iewes.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame place, hee doth highlie commende Chriſtians for Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome Chaſtitie, ſome Hoſpitalitie, ſome Pouertie: But becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries being ſet together, each doe more liuelie appeare in his kinde: Let vs with this Expoſition, compare <hi>M.

                        <hi>My Vowes are vpon mee, I will offer prayſes vnto GOD:</hi> Well aymed I warrant you; The Pſalme fiftie ſixe, written firſt, is the Expoſition of the Pſalme ſeauentie fiue, which was conceited and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after: Againe, in the Pſalme ſeauentie fiue, DAVID ſpeaketh to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: in the other hee ſpeaketh of himſelfe: Thirdly, the Prophets words in Pſalme fiftie ſixe, confirme rather that which he taught before, that all conſiderate Vowes are prayſes and parts of Gods worſhippe, or as the wordes doe more literallie ſounde, becauſe his Vowes, that is, his prayers and deſires were by God accompliſhed, therefore hee would prayſe and thanke him.</p>

                     <p>Let vs now come vnto the ſecond poynt, wherein wee diſſent: They (ſaith M.

We ſay flatly no; holding that lawfull Vowes be ſtayes and props of Gods worſhip, but not the worſhip it ſelfe: this is long ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. But here M. P. ſetteth vp a rotten prop or two, to vp-hold his ruinous buylding, ſaying, S. PAVL ſayth plainely,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 4</note> 
                        <hi>Bodely exerciſe profiteth litle, but godlines profiteth much.</hi> Where are you good Sir? We treat here of Vowes, which are formallie actions of the minde: what do you now about bodely exerciſes? Vowes ars principall parts of that godlines, which is ſo profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if by bodily exerciſe, Faſting, and other corporall paine or labour be vnderſtood, then we ſay, that ſuch things of themſelues would profite litle; but our being directed to the chaſtiſing of the rebellious fleſh, to the end we may leſſe offend, &amp; better ſerue God, then they may much profite vs. But let vs here M.

                     <p>Gods kingdome in it ſelfe ſtandeth not in outward things, and as it is in vs alſo, it doth conſiſt chiefely in inward worſhippe, by faith, hope, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and religion, in whoſe kingdome Vowes hold a honorable ranke: but a great part of this worſhip among vs, dependes of outward things; for be not the two onely parts of Gods worſhip amonge Proteſtants (as M.

And is not faith (which is the roote of all Chriſtian Religion) gotten by outwarde preaching and hearing? But it would wearie a willing man to trayle after all M. P. his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent errors: Let vs then at length come vnto the principall poynt in controuerſie. Catholikes (ſaith he) maintaine ſuch Vowes to be made as are not agreeable to the rules afore-named. The firſt is, that of Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, whereby a man promiſeth to God to keepe chaſtity in a ſingle life, that is, out of the ſtate of Wedlocke. This kinde of Vowe, is flat againſt the word of God, as he ſayeth, which he prooueth firſt out of S. PAVL, <hi>If they can not containe, then let them Marrie:</hi> True, if they haue not Vowed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie before,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> as the common Chriſtians of Corinth, (to whom S. PAVL there ſpeaketh) had not. For ſuch, if they can not liue otherwiſe chaſtelie, it is better they marrie then be burned, that is, defiled with incontinencie. But to them who had Vowed chaſtitie before, S. PAVL, writeth in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtile, <hi>That if they but deſire to marrie, they incurre damnation,</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond is much like:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>It is a doctrine of diuels, to forbid to marrie:</hi> truth, if one ſhould hold mariage in it ſelfe to be wicked, &amp; therefore condemne it in all ſorts of perſons, as <hi>Mountanus,</hi> &amp; the Manichees did. But we haue a more reuerende opinion of marriage, than the Proteſtants themſelues. For we with the Apoſtle<note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> hold it to be a great Sacrament: they, that it is a morall contract onely. Notwithſtanding, we maintaine, that ſuch perſons, who being of ripe yeeres, haue aduiſedly Vowed chaſtitie, may not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; not becauſe marriage is not honorable, but for that they haue ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie promiſed to God the contrarie: which we alſo hold to be better, than if he had married. And ſo to vſe S. AVGVSTINES words, <hi>He forbiddeth to marrie, who ſayeth it to be euill, but not he who before this good thing, preferreth a better.</hi> And a little after, <hi>you ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene perſwaſion to Virginitie, by preferring the greater good before the leſſer, and forbidding to marrie, by accuſing lying together for iſſue.</hi> The firſt is, the doctrine of the Apoſtles, which we teach, the latter only of deuils<note place="margin">Lib 3. cont Fauſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich. cap. 6.</note>.</p>
                     <p>M. P. His third and laſt text is,<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 13.4</note> 
                        <hi>Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed vndefiled.</hi> The ſtrength of this place lyeth a double corruption of the text: For this verbe <hi>(is)</hi> is not in the text, nor cannot be the courſe of the Apoſtles ſpeech, requiring a verbe of the Imperatiue Moode, as both the ſentences beſore and after do conuince.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if you will haue the Apoſtle ſaye, that Marriage is honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among all men; wee muſt alſo needes take him to ſay, that the bedde is alſo vndefiled among all, which was not true.

P.</hi> hath an argument that ſhall neuertheleſſe demonſtrate the Vowe of perpetuall chaſtitie to be intollerable. For (ſayth he) this Vowe is not in the power of him that Voweth: for, continencie is the gifte of God, who giueth it not vnto all, but vnto whom he will, when he will, and as long as he will: And if wee object that by prayer and faſting, the gift of continencie may be obtained of God: he aunſwereth that it cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not neceſſarie to ſaluation: We replie, that it is neceſſarie for all them that haue Vowed chaſtitie: And be it ſo, that God giueth it not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, yet doth he certainely giue it to ſome, for otherwiſe they cannot keepe their Vowes, but to the diſhonour of God, and to their owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhould breake them.</p>
                     <p>And wee onely teach, that ſome ſuch who haue Vowed chaſtitie, could keepe it, ſo that the argument is verie childiſh and too too weake to lead any wiſe man away from the holy and auncient Doctrine of the Church.

                     <p>Saint CHRYSOSTOME ſayeth, it is poſsible to all them who make choyſe of it: and further addeth, that our Sauiour CHRIST himſelfe doeth prooue it there after this ſorte: <hi>Thinke with thy ſelfe if thou haddeſt bene by nature an Eunuch, or by the malice of men made one, what woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou then haue done, when thou ſhouldeſt both haue bene depriued of that pleaſure, and yet not haue had any recompence for thy paine.

                     <p>Wee will wrappe vp this poynte with Saint AVGVSTINE, who directlie confuteth <hi>M. Perk.</hi> by many reaſons and examples: <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De adulterinis coniug. cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Et de bono viduit. cap.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>And vpon the Pſalme, an hundreth thirtie ſeauen, he yeeldeth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, why God will more reallie aſsiſt them, ſaying: <hi>Hee that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth thee to Vowe, vvill helpe thee to fulfill it.</hi> All which heauenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe it is ſpirituallie judged, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) the Carnall man cannot vnderſtande: And therefore <hi>M.

                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:21661:86"/>
                     <p>This may ſerue for a reproofe of al that M. P. objecteth againſt the Vowe of chaſtity: afterward, the man would ſomwhat reaſon the matter by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing howe hee condemneth not chaſtitie: yet ſayeth, that Marriage is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it, in two reſpects, If IOVINIAN was reputed by the learnedſt an holieſt Fathers (a Chriſtian Epicure and a Monſter) becauſe he durſt make marriage equall with Virginitie: What ſhall this man be who ſayeth it is better? His reaſons are ſo childiſh, that by the like you may prooue, durt to be better then gold: wherefore I will not ſtand vpon them.</p>
                     <p>He neuertheleſſe afterwarde concludeth, that one may purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with himſelfe to leade a ſingle life, but ſo as he may change vpon occaſion, and this to be a councell of expedience, but not of perfection.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, that if any hauing the gifte of continencie, doe Vowe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde Marrie (the gift remayning) they haue ſinned, which is flat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne ſecond rule, which prohibites vs to leeſe our libertie, and to make any thing vnlawfull in conſcience, which Chriſtian religion lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth at libertie.</p>
                     <p>Now libertie ſuppoſeth M.

I wil briefely prooue by an argument or two, that it is both lawful &amp; verie commendable for men and women of ripe yeeres; and conſideration hauing wel tryed their own aptneſſe, to Vow virginitie; if by good inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they be thereunto inwardly called. My firſt reaſon is this, that which is more pleaſant and grateful vnto God, may verie well be Vowed to him. but Virginitie is more acceptable to God than Marriage. The firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is manifeſt, and hath no other exception againſt it, but that which before is confuted, to wit, if we be able to performe it. The ſecond is denyed by them, which we prooue in expreſſe tearmes out of S. PAVL<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note>

                        <hi>Bleſſed is the Eunuch which hath wrought no vnrighteoſneſſe. &amp;c.

P.</hi> anſwereth <hi>pag.</hi> 241. that to the Eunuch is promiſed a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde; but, not becauſe of his chaſtitie, but becauſe he keepeth the Lords Saboth and couenant. But this is ſaide vnaduiſedlie; for to all others that keepe Gods commandements, ſhall be giuen a heauenly reward: but why ſhall they haue a better heritage, and more acceptable portion than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but becauſe of their ſpeciall prerogatiue of chaſtitie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. P.</hi> then anſwereth otherwiſe here; that the ſingle life is better and more happie, becauſe it is freer from common cares of this life, and yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs more bodelie eaſe and libertie to ſerue God. But 1200. yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe S. AVGVSTINE of ſet purpoſe confuted this error in ſundrie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his learned workes, ſpeciallie in his Treatiſe, <hi>De virginitie,</hi> in theſe chapters, 13. 23. 24. 25. Where he accounteth him no Chriſtian that doeth contradict, CHRIST promiſing the kingdome of heauen to Eunuchs.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat 19</note> And in the 25. Chapter more vehemently exclayming: <hi>O impious blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, why doeſt thou cauill and ſeeke ſhifts? why doeſt thou promiſe temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie onely to the chaſte and contynent: when God ſayth</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Eſai 16.</note>, <hi>I will giue them an euerlaſting name: And if thou wouldeſt perhaps take this euerlaſting, for a thing of long continuance: I adde, inculcate, and often repeale, that it ſhall neuer haue end. What wouldeſt thou more? This eternall name, whatſoeuer it be, ſignifyeth a certaine peculiar and excellent glorie, which ſhall not be common to many, albeit they be placed in the ſame kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> Which in the 29. Chapter he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth out of that place of the Apocalips, cited aboue in theſe wordes: <hi>The reſt of the faithfull ſhall ſee you, and not enuie your eſtate, but ioye in it, and ſo be partaker of that in you which they haue not in themſelues: For the new ſong which is proper vnto you they cannot ſing, but ſhall heare it, and bee delighted with your ſo excellent a bleſſedneſſe: but you, becauſe you ſhal both ſing and heare it, ſhall more happilie reioyce and raigne more pleaſantly.</hi> Which may be alſo confirmed out of the Apoſtles in the ſame place: where he aſſureth that the ſingle life is better for the ſeruice of God, ſaying; that a woman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married and a Virgin, thinke of the things which belong vnto our Lord; how ſhe may pleaſe God, and be holy both in body and ſpirite. And our bleſſed Sauiour teacheth,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 19</note> That ſome become Eunuches for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen: which, to bee taken there properlie for the rewarde in heauen. Saint AVGVSTINE, (with the reſt of the Fathers) teacheth:<note n="*" place="margin">De vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginit. cap. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>What could be ſpoken more truely or more perſpicuouſlie?</hi> CHRIST ſayth, <hi>The trueth ſayeth the Wiſdome of God affirmeth them to geld themſelues for the kingdome of heauen, who doe of a godlie determination refrayne from marriage: And contrarilie, humane vanitie doth contende by impious temerity that they who do ſo, do it to auoyde the neceſſarie troubles of Matrimonie, and that in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21661:87"/> kingdome of heauen, they ſhall haue no more than other men.</hi> Secondly, al the Proteſtants doctrine for marriage, and againſt Vowes, is notably confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by S. PAVL,<note n="*" place="margin">Tim. 5</note> where he ſayeth: That <hi>there were then certaine Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, who when they waxed wanton againſt</hi> CHRIST, <hi>would marrie, hauing damnation</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>becauſe they made voyde and caſt awaie their firſt faith:</hi> which was as Saint AVGVSTINE<note n="*" place="margin">De ſanct. virg. ca. 23.</note> and the reſte of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers expounde it, they had Vowed continencie, but would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe young Widdowes (if the Proteſtants doctrine were true) not hauing the gift of continencie, did verie well to marrie, and were in no ſorte bounde to keepe their Vowes, which was not in their power: But the Apoſtle doeth not acquit them of their Vowe, but teacheth that they were bounde to keepe it; in that hee pronounceth damnation to them if they marrie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlie, the example of our heauenly Sauiour, who would neuer marrie: and of the bleſſed Virgin S. MARY, who<note n="*" place="margin">Aug cap. 44. de uirg. Bed. 1. Luc</note> Vowed perpetuall virginity. And of the glorious Apoſtles, as who S. IEROM witneſſeth,<note n="*" place="margin">Cle. Alex lib. 3. ſtom Lib. 1. cont Iouin. In apol. 2. ad Aut. Tertul. ap. 2. cap. 9</note> were in parte Virgins; and all after their following of Chriſt, abſtayned from the companie of their Wiues. And of the beſte Chriſtians in the pureſt antiquitie, who as IVSTINIVS, one of the auncienteſt Greeke authors among Chriſtians: And TERTVLLIAN his peere among the Latines, do teſtifie, * did liue perpetuall Virgins.</p>
                     <p>Out of theſe examples, wee frame this Argument.</p>
                     <p>Our Captaines and ring-leaders, who knew well which was the beſte way; and whoſe examples wee are to followe as neere as wee can, Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virginitie: wee muſt needes eſteeme that ſtate for more perfect, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie, when as the ſingle man careth onely how to pleaſe God, that to be holie in bodie and minde (as the Apoſtle writes) when as the married are choked with cares of this worlde. And vnleſſe a man had made a league with hell, or were as blinde as a Beetle, howe can hee euer perſwade himſelfe, that to wallow in fleſhlie pleaſure and ſatiſfying of the beaſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, is as grateful to God, as to conquere and ſubdue them by Faſting and Prayer.</p>
                     <p>Finally, if S. PAVL giue counſell to the married, to conteyne during the time of Prayer<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7</note> Prieſtes and religious (that muſt alwaies be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to miniſter the Sacraments, and to thinke vpon ſuch things as belong vnto our Lord) are therefore vpon a great conſideration bounde to perpetuall chaſtitie.</p>
                     <p>We will cloſe vp this poynt with ſome ſentences taken out of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, in prayſe of Virginitie, which <hi>M. P.</hi> in all this queſtion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21661:87"/> vouchſafeth ſcarce once to name, as though Virgins and Virginitie were no Engliſh wordes, or not as playne as continencie.</p>
                     <p>S. CIPRIAN, <hi>De habitu Virginum:</hi> Intitleth Virgins to be the moſt noble and glorious parſon of Chriſts flocke: and addeth, that they ſhall receiue of God the higheſt rewarde and greateſt recompence.</p>
                     <p>S. CHRYSOSTOME<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3. cont. vitup. vit. neceſſ.</note> ſyteth, Virginitie to be the top of perfection, and the higheſt typ of vertue.</p>
                     <p>And ATHANASIVS, <hi>De virginitate;</hi> in the ende burſteth out into theſe words: O virginitie, a treaſure that waſteth not, a garland that wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth not; the Temple of God, the Palace of the Holy Ghoſt, a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtone, whoſe price is vnknowen to the vulgar, the joye of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the glorie of the Apoſtles, the life of Angels, the Crowne of Saints.</p>
                     <p>S. AMBROSE <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Virginibus paulo poſt init.</hi> Virginitie is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall vertue, and not therefore commendable that it is found in Marters, but becauſe it maketh Marters: Who can with humaine wit comprehend it which nature doeth not holde within her Lawes, it hath fetched out of Heauen that it might imitate on Earth: neither vnfitly hath it ſought a manner of life in heauen, which hath founde a ſpouſe for her in heauen.</p>
                     <p>This ſurmounting the clouds, the ſtarres and Angels hath found the word of God in the boſome of his Father; &amp;c. See who liſt to read more to this purpoſe the reſt of the Fathers in their workes of Virginitie; of which moſt of them haue written. And S. IEROM, who is behinde none of the reſt in his bookes againſt <hi>Iouinian</hi> and <hi>Heluidius,</hi> all which doe moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently exhort to Vowe Virginitie; doe teach how to keepe it, and moſt vehemently inveigh againſt all them that doe breake it. And if any bee ſo madde as to credite rather our fleſhlie miniſters, than all that honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and holy ſenate of the auncient Fathers, he deſerueth to liue and dye in perpetuall darkneſſe.</p>

                     <p>As the verie propoſition (that it is diſpleaſing to God to cut off all cares of the worlde, and to be-take our ſelues whollie to his holie ſeruice and contemplation of heauenlie matters) is in it ſelfe profaine and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſo the proofe thereof is devoyde of naturall witte and ſenſe.

                     <p>I allowe both the text and the gloſſe, and finde nothing there againſt Religious perſons, whoſe calling is ſpeciall perfect, and therefore beſt warrantable; not ſo (ſayeth he) becauſe they giue themſelues to prayer and faſting: What a profaine ſtupiditie is this? Is not a life giuen to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faſting agreeable to the will of God, and Lawes of his Church? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many religious men do ouer and beſides verie great ſeruices to Gods Church, in Preaching, teaching, and writing of moſt learned bookes. But ſuppoſe they did nothing elſe but faſt and pray, did they not very wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their ſuſtenance? yes much better than they which trauaile all the yeare about the prouiding of it: For in vayne do men labour, if God bleſſe not their worke, with ſeaſonable weather, which hee doeth rather at the Prayer and inſtance of ſuch good innocent ſoules, that are to be fed with it, than for the Plough-mans owne labours ſake. And if by their Faſting, Watching, and ſuch like afflictions of their bodies, they do partly ſatiſfie for our ſuperfluous pampering of the fleſh, and teacheth vs by their good example to bridle and correct it: doe they not deſerue at our hands bode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſuſtenance? And who better performes all dueties of the ſecond Table than they, being moſt obedient to all their Superiours, and not hurting their neighbour in life, perſons, or any maner of their goodes? And ſo in their ſeuerall callings offend no honeſt men, and do much good both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church and common wealth.</p>
                     <p>After all this waſte-winde, <hi>M. P.</hi> confeſſeth, that a man may vpon a ſpeciall calling, ſell all his goodes, as the Apoſtles did. What then (good Sir) ſhall become of your former arguments? May one then Vowe a curſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21661:89"/> of the Law, and leaue of prayer, neither pouertie nor riches, and ſay that it is not a bleſſeder thing to giue, then to receiue.</p>
                     <p>All theſe arguments which were whilom of great force, muſt now bee nothing worth: becauſe it pleaſeth <hi>M. P.</hi> the winde now ſits in an other corner, ſuch weather-cockes ſurely are to be much reſpected.</p>
                     <p>He ſayeth further; in time of perſecution, a man may alſo leaue all: he ſhould rather haue ſaid, he muſt leaue all, or elſe looſe all; for the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor wil not ſpare him. Laſtlie, he doth not condemne old ancient Monks, who liued by the ſweate of their browes, and were married, manie of them, as he ſayeth, but his authors cited, ſayeth not ſo, neither ſhall hee be able to cite one auncient allowed and approoued writer, who ſayeth that the auncient Monkes liued with their wiues, if perhaps they had bene married before. But no maruaile if fleſhlie miniſters thinke it no life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their fleſhlie mates. As for labouring at vacant times, it was alwaies, and is to this daye in practiſe among many religions. If other do in good ſtudies, writing or teaching, imploy that time of labour, no doubt but they do farre better.</p>
                     <p>In defence of the Catholike partie, <hi>M. P.</hi> hath not a worde, wherefore I will briefely ſupplie his want and prooue it to be very gratefull to God to ſell all, and giue it to the poore.</p>
                     <p>I omit the example of our B. Sauiour, (who would not haue any poore cottage of his owne, ſo much as to reſt his head in, but would wholly liue of almes) and come vnto his heauenly doctrine.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat 19</note> Hee teacheth a young man whom he loued, in flat wordes, <hi>That if he would be perfect, hee ſhould go and ſell al he had, and giue it to the poore, and come and follow him, and then ſhould haue a treaſure in heauen.</hi> Theſe words are ſo expreſſe and euident, that there can be but one way to ſhift from them, which <hi>M. P.</hi> flyeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pag.</hi> 244. to witt, that theſe wordes were onely meant vnto that yong man, and not to be applyed vnto any others, no more than thoſe wordes to ABRAHAM of ſacrificing his ſonne ISAAC. But this ſeely ſhift of our poore Proteſtants is confuted, manifeſtly in the ſame chapter of Sainte MATTHEVV, where a little after S. PETER ſayeth. <hi>Lord, behold we haue left all things, and haue followed thee, what rewarde ſhall we therefore haue:</hi> We haue done (as S. HIEROM expoundeth it, and the verie ſequele of the text doth plainely require) that which thou commaundeſt in the wordes before, to that yong man, What anſwere made our Sauiour? That his commandement was onely meant vnto that young man, and that they had done fooliſhlie in ſo doing, nothing leſſe, but promiſeth that they ſhall therefore ſit with him in twelue ſeates, iudging the twelue tribes of Iſrael. And that who-ſo-euer would forſake Father, Mother,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21661:89"/> Landes, goodes, &amp;c. for his ſake, ſhould receiue an hundreth fold, and poſſeſſe life euerlaſting. Can any thing be more plaine out of the word of God it ſelfe, than that, not this or that man, but whoſoeuer ſhall forſake all for Chriſt, doeth verie bleſſedlie. And if neede were, I could cite moſt of the auncient Fathers, teaching thoſe wordes of Chriſt, <hi>Goe and ſell all,</hi> to be an heauenly counſell giuen generallie vnto all. S. ANTONY tooke them ſpoken to him, <hi>In vita eius apud Athanaſ.</hi> S. AVGVSTINE to him. <hi>ad Hilarium</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. 89.</note>: to omit latter Religious men, I will onely cite S. HIEROM who doeth briefely both declare our Catholike doctrine, and ſhewes alſo who was the Author of the Proteſtants opinion,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. cont. vigilant.</note> ſaying thus: <hi>To that which thou affirmeſt, that they doe better, who vſe their goods, and do by little and litle diſtribute to the poore, the profites of their poſſeſsions, then others who ſelling them, giue all at once, not I, but our Lord ſhall anſwere: If thou wilt bee perfect, goe and ſell all thou haſt and giue it to the poore.</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſpeaketh to him that will be perfect</hi> (not to the young man onely) <hi>who with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, forſooke both father ſhippe and nettes:</hi> That which thou VIGILAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVS commendeſt, obtayneth <hi>the ſecond and third degree: ſo that the firſt</hi> (which is to ſell all at once) <hi>bee preferred before the ſeconde and thirde:</hi> Which is, to giue by little and little, the fruite of our reuenues to the poore.</p>
                     <p>I might confirme this former argument, with the example of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide beſt Chriſtians,<note n="*" place="margin">Act 4.</note> who hauing poſſeſsions and landes, ſolde all and brought the price of them, and layde it at the Apoſtles feete: and more yet enforce it by the fact of ANANIAS and SAPHIRA, his wife, who hauing ſold all theirs, preſented but part of the money vnto the Apoſtles, and reſerued the reſt vnto them ſelues. Be-like they were of <hi>M. P.</hi> his minde, that it is better to giue then to receiue, and therefore kept part to that purpoſe; but they therefore were both puniſhed with preſent death: Which prooueth invincibly, both how laudable it is to ſell all, and howe dangerous to halte in ſuch holy workes.</p>
                     <p>But to auoyde prolixitie, I doe but poynt at the places: And that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANIAS; as the reſt had promiſed this to God (which is a Vowe) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the text, where it is ſaide, that hee lyed not vnto men, but vnto God, in not performing his promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And here we deduce verie cleerelie, that ſuch a Vowe is much pleaſing vnto God thus: That which is commended by our Sauiours owne both example and doctrine, and was practized by the Apoſtles and moſt holy Chriſtians, that may be Vowed very laudablie: but to ſell all and giue it to the poore is ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Nowe one worde of obedience before wee ende this queſtion. This
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21661:90"/> Vowe ſayeth <hi>M. P.</hi> is againſt Chriſtian libertie, whereby we haue gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs a free vſe of all things indifferent, and therefore to bee bounde to certaine meates and apparrell is intollerable: but this reaſon hath bene reprooued alreadie:<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5.10</note> he addeth, <hi>ſtand faſt in the libertie wherein Chriſt hath made you free:</hi> Doeth your breath or heart fayle you Sir, that you ſtop thus in the middeſt of a ſentence, the reſt belike diſcouereth the fraud of it: <hi>And wrap not your ſelues againe in the yoke of bondage,</hi> to wit, bynde not yor ſelues to the obſeruation of MOSES Law, as yee ſhall doe if ye be Circumciſed. All this is good; but doeth it followe hereof, that in the Law of grace, wee ſhould not obey our ſuperiours, nor obſerue ſuch good orders as Holie Church hath approoued nothing leſſe: but happie is that neceſsitie as S. AVGVSTINE witneſſeth, which holdeth vs cloſe to thoſe things which be better to doe, than to leaue vndone, otherwiſe our weakneſſe would quickly ſhrinke backe. And againe, if Chriſts ſufferings, without his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as <hi>M. P.</hi> himſelfe teſtifyeth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 61.) had not bene avayleable for our juſtifycation: No doubt, but thoſe workes which are garniſhed with the vertue of obedience, are more acceptable in Gods ſight.</p>
                     <p>Finally <hi>M. P.</hi> ſayeth, that we magnifie theſe three Vowes of Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pouertie, and obedience: And good reaſon haue wee ſo to do, as hath bene ſhewed: but ſayeth he, for the Vowe of Baptiſme, we hath made no ſuch account of it, as they do; which is not ſo: We holde indeed that the couenant which we make in Baptiſme, is no Vow, but a full and aſſured promiſe to beleeue in God, to renounce the deuill and all his workes, and to keepe all Gods commandements, which we keepe or do our beſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to keepe; at leaſt wee teach not as the Proteſtants doe, that they are impoſsible to be kept, for that is enough to diſcourage any man from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring to keepe them. And as touching the Vowe which he ſaith wee made in our Creation, we remember nothing of it, nor neuer heard ſpeake of it by any good author, not that we make, or meane we any Vowes when we receiue the B. Sacrament. Theſe be but nouelties of words, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening of ſome decayed wits.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE Acknowledge the ciuill vſe of Images, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and truelie as the Church of Rome doeth. By ciuill vſe, I vnderſtande that which is made of them in the common ſocietie of men, out of the appoynted places of the ſolemne worſhippe of GOD: And this to bee lawfull appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the arts of paynting and grauing are the Ordinances of GOD, and to be skilfull in them is the gift of GOD, as the example of BEZALEEL and AHOLIAB declare.<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 35.</note> This vſe of Images may be in ſundrie things. Firſt in adoring and ſetting forth of buyldings; ſo the Lord commaunded his Temple to bee adorned with Images of Palme-trees and Pomegranates; of Buls, Cherubs, and ſuch like. Secondly, they ſerue for diſtinction of coynes. Thirdly, Images ſerue to keepe in memorie friends departed whom wee reuerence, and therefore in the dayes after the Apoſtles, Chriſtians vſed priuatelie to keepe the Pictures of their friendes departed; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde (ſayeth he) by abuſe came to be ſet in Churches and worſhipped, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Second concluſion: We hold the Hiſtoricall vſe of Images to bee good and lawfull: that is, to repreſent to the eye the actes of Hiſtories, whether they be humaine or diuine; and thus wee thinke that the hiſtories of the Bible may be paynted in priuate places.</p>
                     <p>Third concluſion: In one caſe it is lawfull to make an Image, to teſtifie the preſence or effects of the majeſtie of God; namely, when God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21661:91"/> commandes it: ſo was the brazen Serpent made to repreſent Chriſt crucifyed<note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> and the Cherubs ouer the Mercie ſeate, to repreſent the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie of God, when the Angels adore: And therefore it is ſaide: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe</hi> (that is vpon thine owne head) <hi>any grauen Image:</hi> This by the way is a verie wilfull peruerting of thoſe wordes <hi>(to thy ſelfe)</hi> which cannot ſignifie, but, to thine owne vſe, that is, to adore them, as is plainely declared in the text following.</p>
                     <p>The fourth concluſion: The right Images of the New Teſtament are the doctrine and Preaching of the Goſpell, wherein Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites are liuely repreſented vnto vs: but theſe be metaphoricall Pictures, not belonging to this purpoſe: for it is one thing to deſcribe in words, an other to expreſſe in liuely colours, and liueaments</p>
                     <p>Theſe concluſions conteyne, as <hi>M, P.</hi> affirmeth, the doctrine of the Church of England; which I would beleeue, if I did not ſee the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates publikelie to take away Pictures from Catholikes, to teare and burne them, which were kept but in priuate places: yea, their more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent diſciples, cannot abide a Croſſe ſtanding by the High-waie-ſide, or in any, neuer ſo profaine a place, but either they beate and hale them downe, or moſt deſpitefullie deface them: bewraying indeed vnto all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men, their cankered ſtomaks againſt him that dyed on the Croſſe: who will one daye (when he pleaſeth) confounde them. But to couer this their malice, they caſte ouer it the mantle of zeale, ſaying that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes make them their Gods, and that therefore they are to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                     <p>O men blinded with ſpite againſt true deuotion. We Catholikes are a thouſand times more zealous of the true honour of the liuing God, than any Proteſtants euer were or will be: And that ſmall reuerence which we yeelde vnto Images, is more different from the honour and obedience due vnto Almightie God, than the cope of heauen is diſtant from the center of the earth.</p>
                     <p>And that theſe hotter brethren may ſee what reaſon <hi>M. P.</hi> had to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe of the ciuill and hiſtoricall vſe of Images: I thinke it expediente to note here, howe in the pureſt antiquitie, Images were made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
                     <p>That famous Image of our bleſſed Sauiour, which the woman cured of the bloudie flxe,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> ſet vp in Braſſe at <hi>Caeſarea Philippi,</hi> vpon a Piller of ſtone, is not vnknowen vnto any that haue read the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of EVSEBIVS, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. And howe God did approoue it by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vertue vnto an herbe when it did growe, to touch the hemme of that Picture, to cure all maner of diſeaſes. Which Image, EVSEBIVS
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21661:91"/> himſelfe did ſee ſtanding vntill his dayes, which was 1300. yeares agoe, as he there teſtfyeth: as alſo, that he ſawe diuers others, namely, of Saint PETER and PAVL.</p>
                     <p>This goodly ſtature being moſt memorable both for antiquitie of it, being made our Sauiour yet liuing, and for the myracles wrought by that herbe, growing at the foote of it, IVLIAN the Apoſtata for malice againſt our Sauiour, cauſed to bee broken downe, and ſet vppe his owne Image in the place of it: but his was preſently with lightning and thunder from heauen conſumed into aſhes, and our Souiours, by the Chriſtians carryed into their Church, as witneſſeth ZOZOMENIVS.<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 5. hiſt. c. 20.</note>

                     <p>NOw to the poynts in controuerſie, which are three, as <hi>M. P.</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: The firſt is, in that the Church of Rome holdes it lawfull to make Images to reſemble God; though not in reſpect of his diuine nature, yet in reſpect of ſome properties &amp; actions: We contrarily ſaith M.

                  <div type="subpart">
                     <head>ANSWERE.</head>
                     <p>This paſſeth all kinde of impudencie to quote the Roman Catechiſme in defence of that opinion, which it doth of ſet purpoſe diſprooue. It tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth indeed, that the verie nature and ſubſtance of God, which is, wholy ſpirituall, cannot be expreſſed and figured by corporall lineaments and colours, and alleadgeth the places produced by <hi>M. P.</hi> to prooue that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; yet by and by annexeth theſe words: <hi>Let no man therefore thinke it to be againſt religion, and the Law of God, when any perſon of the moſt holy Trinitie is purtraited in ſuch ſort as they haue appeared, either in the Old or New Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>let the Paſtor teach, that not the nature of God, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21661:93"/> certaine properties and actions appertaining to God, are repreſented in ſuch Pictures.</hi> If the man be not paſt grace, he will ſuerly bluſh at ſuch a foule error. His textes of Scripture are taken out of the ſame place of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, and doe prooue onely, that Gods proper nature cannot nor may not be reſembled in any corporall ſhape or likeneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>M. P.</hi> returnes to confute the aunſwere made him; that Idols are there onely prohibited, and ſayeth that wee then confounde the firſt and ſeconde commandement. For in the firſt was forbidden, all falſe Gods which man frames vnto himſelfe, by giuing his heart and the principall affections thereof vnto them. (Good) and in the ſecond, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be the ſecond) is forbidden to drawe into any materiall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that Idoll which the heart had before framed vnto it ſelfe, and to giue it any bodelie worſhippe: which is diſtinction good enough to make two ſeuerall commandements. Now the Roman Catechiſme, following CLEMENT of <hi>Alexandria: Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>ſtromat.</hi> And S. AVGVSTINE <hi>Queſt.</hi> 71. <hi>ſuper exod,</hi> and <hi>ep.</hi> 119. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. and the Schoole-doctors in 3. <hi>ſent. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct.</hi> 37. doeth make two commandements of the Proteſtants laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing, deſiring thy neighbours wife, from coueting thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goodes, as they doe: <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie,</hi> from, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſteale;</hi> and make but one of the firſte two, becauſe the former doeth forbid inwarde, and the ſecond outwarde Idolatrie: and the outwarde and inwarde actions: about the ſaid object are not ſo diſtinct, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring of ſo diuerſe things, as a mans wife for leacherie, and his goods of couetouſneſſe: And yet beſides, adde an other reaſon very probable, that the rewarde and puniſhment belonging alike to all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cannot in good order be thruſt into the middle of them, but muſt be placed either with the firſt or laſt, now comprehending the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in one, the rewarde is annexed conueniently to the firſt; whereas, if you make them two, it is out of order, and without any good reaſon put after the ſecond. This I ſay, not to condemne the other deuiſion, which many of the auncient writers follow: but to ſhew how little reaſon <hi>M. P.</hi> had to truſt to that anſwere of his, that we ſhould confounde the firſt and ſecond, which hee ſaw the verie Catechiſme cited by himſelfe, doe make but one of both. But <hi>M. P.</hi> goeth on and ſayeth, that our diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Image and Idoll (that an Image repreſenteth a thing that is, but Idoll, a thing ſuppoſed to be, but is not) is falſe and againſt the auncient writers, who make it all one: Wee prooue the contrarie, Firſt, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ancient Doctors, ORIGEN<note n="*" place="margin">Hom. 8. in exod. Q. 38 in ex</note> and THEODORET, * who in expreſſe wordes deliuer the ſame difference of Image and Idoll: which is taken out of S. PAVL,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> ſaying that an Idoll is nothing in the world:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21661:93"/> that is, ſuch Idols as the Heathen take for their Gods, are nothing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallie, that is, though they bee great peeces of wood or ſtone materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie; yet they repreſent a thing that is not, that is, ſuch a thing to bee a God, which is nothing leſſe. Let <hi>M. P.</hi> but quote one place in the whole Bible, where they are vſed both for one.</p>
                     <p>I will cite ſome-where, if you vſe the one for the other, you muſt offende all good Chriſtian eares; As where man is ſaide to be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of God, may you ſay after the Idoll of God? CHRIST is ſaide to be the Image of his Father; will you call him the Idoll of his Father? Surely hee cannot denie, but the ſeauenth generall Counſell holden about nine hundreth yeares paſt and gone, is ſo farre off from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Image and Idoll all one, that it doeth accurſe all them, who call the Image of CHRIST and his Saints, Idols.</p>
                     <p>But TERTVLLIAN<note n="*" place="margin">De Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolat.</note> (ſayeth <hi>M. P.</hi>) affirmeth them to bee all one; not ſo neither: For hee maketh <hi>Idolum</hi> a diuinitie of <hi>eibos,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth a forme or ſimilitude: So that <hi>Idolon,</hi> is but a ſmall ſimilitude or ſlender Image, not ſo much for the quantitie, as for that it repreſenteth but darkely.</p>
                     <p>EVSTATHIVS an excellent Greeke interpreter, vppon the elleuenth booke of HOMERS ODISSEA, deſcrybeth <hi>Idolum</hi> to ſignifye a vayne and vaniſhing Image, as the ſhaddowe of a man, a ghoſt, or phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Imagination. And ſo it cannot bee, that all profaine Authors vſe theſe two wordes indifferentlie, ſeeing both in proper ſignifycation, and by the declaration of the learned, there is greate difference betweene them.</p>
                     <p>But Saint STEPHEN calles the golden calfe an Idoll, ſo it was indeed: What is that to the purpoſe?</p>
                     <p>And S. HIEROM ſayeth, That Idols are the Images of dead-men (adde) that are taken for Gods: True, manie Idols bee Images: all ſuch as truely repreſente any perſon that was once liuing heere, but no Images bee Idols, vnleſſe it bee taken for a GOD: And ſo Idolles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires beſides the Image, that it bee made a God, or the Image of a falſe God.</p>
                     <p>Nowe to thoſe fewe authorities which <hi>M.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21661:94"/> of Images in gemeral, it were not proper to this purpoſe, where we ſpeake onely of making Images, and not of all ſortes of Images neither, but of an Image onely to repreſent ſome properties or actions of God.</p>
                     <p>That out of ORIGNE<note n="*" place="margin">Cont. cell. lib. 7.</note> is yet farre wyder; Wee <hi>ſuffer not any to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe</hi> IESVS <hi>at Altars, Images or Temples, becauſe it is written: Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods.</hi> Here is nothing concerning the making of Gods Image; onely Chriſtians are forbidden to goe vnto the heathen Temples, and there at their Altars or Idols to worſhippe IESVS, who hath no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie nor can endure any fellowſhippe with Idolaters.</p>
                     <p>Hauing confuted the Proteſtants arguments againſt the making I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, to repreſent ſome propertie or action of God; I nowe come vnto Catholike proofe of them.

                     <p>This firſt is flat againſt his owne ſecond concluſion, where he holdeth it lawfull to preſent to the eye in Pictures, any hiſtories of the Bible in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate places, both the foreſaide apparitions bee in the Olde teſtament, and therefore may be painted in priuate places, which cannot be truely done without you doe repreſent God in the ſame likeneſſe, as there hee appeared.

                     <p>This argument may bee confirmed by the pictures of Angels, of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21661:94"/> Vertues, and other ſuch like of ſpirituall or accidentall nature: for if ſuch things as haue no bodelie proportion or ſhape, may notwithſtanding bee counterfeit and reſembled in ſome qualities, why may not ſome proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or action of God be in like manner repreſented? That thou mayeſt (Reader) vnderſtande the better what wee meane, obſerue that pictures repreſent after three ſorts. Some expreſſe to the quick, the very ſhape, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and colour of the patterne; as the liuely picture of man, or of any ſuch corporall thing: others repreſent things as they did appeare and were acted, as if the Paynter ſhould expreſſe the meeting of God with ABRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM and his entertainement, he muſt then reſemble God in the ſame likeneſſe of a man in which he ſhewed himſelfe to ABRAHAM.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, an Image of a ſpirituall thing, may be drawen not to reſemble the nature of it, but to leade our vnderſtanding by ſuch a ſimilitude, into ſome better knowledge of that thing: ſo are Angels paynted like goodly young men with wings; to teach vs that they be of an excellent pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, euer flouriſhing and moſt readie to diſpatch with all expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imployment to which God ſends them; and ſo may God the Father be pourtraited, as a goodly old graue man, ſitting in his throne of majeſtie, attended vppon by millions of Angels, (as he is deſcribed in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.) to inſtruct vs how he is eternall, infinite, wiſe, and of moſt redoubtable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie: In either of theſe two latter ſorts, we hold that God may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and ſo in the ſeauenth generall Councell, the drawing of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt, in forme of a Doue, as he appeared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. is approoued.</p>
                     <p>The firſt poynt then being obtayned, that ſuch Images of God may be made; I come to the ſeconde: That all holie Pictures may bee placed in Churches; which I prooue by the argument that <hi>M. P.</hi> made for our firſt objection. In SALOMONS Temple were erected Cherubins, which were Images of Angels, on the Mercie ſeate, where God was worſhipped, and vppon the walles and verie doores of the ſame pictured. To this <hi>M. P.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that they were erected by ſpeciall commandement from God, who preſcribeth the verie forme of them, and the place where they ſhould be ſet, and thereby MOSES had a warrant to make them, let them ſhewe the like warrant for their Images, if they can.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, (ſayth he) the Cherubs were placed in the moſt inward place of the Temple, &amp; ſo were remooued from the ſight of the people, and the Cherubs without the vaile, though they were ſeene, yet were they not. worſhipped.</p>

                     <p>This mans wits were gone a wool-gathering, when propoſing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21661:95"/> the Cherubs erected in SALOMONS Temple: he anſwereth of the Cherubs made by MOSES 350. yeares before; a moſt groſſe ouer-ſight and a ſhameful ſhift: but ſuch as men deſperatly defending vntruths, muſt needes vſe: For if he had anſwered directly, he had not had a word to ſaye; for neither did God preſcribe the forme of them, nor giue any ſpeciall commandement to SALOMON, to make and erect any ſuch Cherubs, as he that pleaſeth to read the Chapter may ſee, &amp; there they were placed not onely in the inwarde, but alſo in the outward parts of the Temple, vpon the walles and very doores, that they might be ſeene of all the people: which <hi>M. P.</hi> finding, flitted from thence, and did flie vnto an other, which becauſe it ſpake of Cherubs, he thought would ſerue to blinde his ſimple followers.</p>
                     <p>MOSES indeed had an expreſſe precept for the making of them, as he had for the Curteines and Curteine-rods, and euery particular belonging to the Tabernacle. But SALOMON without any ſpeciall commandement out of his high and holy wiſedome, vnderſtood that he might moſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and lawdably imitate that heauenly patterne of MOSES: And as the building was far more ſumptuous and ſtately: ſo in the number and quantie of pictures exceeded, which is a ſufficient inſtruction &amp; warrant for all men after his daies to make and ſet Images in the Church. And this finallie <hi>M. P.</hi> ſeemes to graunt, when he ſayeth, that theſe Cherubs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the veyle, were there to be ſeene, but not to be worſhipped: ſo that wee haue gotten one ſtep further; that Images may not onely be made, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be ſet vp in the Churches: which is fortifyed by the teſtimonie of TER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVLLIAN, in the place cited before: where he ſayeth, that our Sauiour was pictured vpon holy Chalices, which were vſed at the Altars: and of SOZOMENVS, who witneſſeth that our Sauiours Picture was taken into the Church.</p>

And the reaſon why Images ſhould principallie be ſet in Churches, is verie pregnant. For where ſhould holy pictures of holy men be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie beſtowed, than in holie places: And the Church being a reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of heauen (as S.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21661:95"/> vp with Images: the repreſentations of heauenlie creatures: that men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into that holie place, may by the viewe and conſideration of ſuch a heauenly ſhewe, retire their mindes from worldly buſineſſe, and lift them vp vnto the ſoueraigne monarch of both heauen and earth.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs come to thoſe two objections of <hi>M. P.</hi> which ſeemes to bee againſt the erection of Images in Churches. The firſt is out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of ELIBERIS <hi>cap.</hi> 36. which commaundeth, that nothing ſhould bee paynted on the walles of the Church, that was adored of the people.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="subpart">
                     <head>ANSWERE.</head>
                     <p>That if the Councel ſpeake of the Image of God (in which ſenſe. <hi>M. P.</hi> cyteth it, and the word <hi>(adored)</hi> doeth inſinuate) then it may bee ſaide, that the Councell inhibiteth that ſort of Gods Images, which are made to expreſſe the diuine nature: If it be extended vnto all ſorts of Images: I anſwere, that they were then forbidden to be drawen vpon the Church walles, but not to be ſet in Tables vpon the Altar, or in any other place. The reaſon is, becauſe that Councell was holden in time of perſecution, as appeareth by the twentie fiue Canon of it: and then, if the perſecutors had found out the place of their aſſembly, as they often did: thoſe pictures muſt needes either haue bene defaced by themſelues, or left vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion and deſpight of the Heathens; And pictures alſo paynted vpon ſuch poore walles as they had then to their Churches, would either by the moyſture of the walles, or other incommoditie, haue bene quick y disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured: wherefore, to the greater honour of ſuch ſacred things, thoſe graue Fathers thought it not meete to haue them drawen vpon the Church walles, there being manie more meete places for them in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond objection is out of a poſt-ſcript of EPIPHANIVS letter, vnto IOHN PATRIARKE of Ieruſalem, in which is written, as <hi>M. P.</hi> falſely reporteth: that it is againſt the authoritie of Scripture, to ſee the Pictures of Chriſt, or of any Saint to hang in the Church.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="subpart">
                     <head>ANSWERE.</head>
                     <p>It is there only, to ſee the picture of a man. Now that he ſhould meane of Chriſt or of ſome Saint is onely gathered, yet <hi>M. P.</hi> makes no bones to thruſt them both into the Texte: euen ſo doe wee thinke that ſome olde enemie of Images added that poſtſcript vnto EPIPHANIVS letter.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21661:96"/> Our reaſons are, becauſe it hath no coherence with the former letter or ſtile. Againe, in the ſeauenth Councell, when all that could be found out of antiquitie, was cited againſt Images: no tidings there of this place, which if it had bene true, might haue bene one of the principall. Thirdly, in the ſame Councell,<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 6.</note> other two places brought, as it were out of EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHANIVS workes, were found to be none of his: And for Images was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, that EPIPHANIVS owne diſciples, erected an Image to their maiſter, and ſet it in the Church; which they would neuer haue done, if he had taught them to be againſt the Scripture ſo to doe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. P.</hi> obſerues a ſpeciall reaſon in EPIPHANIVS other counterfeit teſtimonie: That Images muſt not be ſuffered in the common houſe, becauſe wee muſt carrie God in our mindes. To which we anſwere, that Images muſt be ſuffred in all places, that we may the better carrie God in our harts, being by the ſight of them, both often put in minde of him, and much mooued to honour and loue him.</p>
                     <p>Now I come vnto a third poynt, which <hi>M. P.</hi> maketh the ſecond of our difference: That Images may be not only made and ſet in Churches, but alſo worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. P.</hi> holds the contrarie: and his principall ground is the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; which containes, ſaith he, two parts. The firſt, forbids the making of Images to reſemble God; the ſecond, the worſhipping of them or God in them, in theſe words: <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow downe to them.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>If it bee onely forbidden to make the Image of God, and to adore it: then the making and worſhipping of the Image of Chriſt, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature, is not there prohibited: And ſo this ſecond commandement more than thriſe alleadged, will not ſerue the turne againſt any other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage but God onely. And in plaine reaſon, according alſo to <hi>M. P.</hi> his owne confeſſion, the Commandements of the firſt Table, touch only our duety towardes God, that wee giue him all his due honour, and doe not giue any parte thereof vnto any thing elſe whatſoeuer: Wherefore diuine and godlie worſhip is onely there ſpoken of, and not ſuch worſhip as wee giue vnto any creature, or to the picture of it: And conſequently, there is nothing there againſt the worſhipping of our holy Images.</p>
                     <p>Obſerue that there is a ſoueraigne worſhip due to God, as to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and gouernor of all the world, and to giue this to any creature, is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. An other honour by infinite degrees inferiour, yet abſolute in it ſelf, is aſcribed vnto Angels, and men as creatures endued with reaſon, and made after the likeneſſe of God; and to exhibite this to whom it is due, is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21661:96"/> ciuilite and not Idolatrie. This honour may be deuided into two parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe creatures are like to God, aſwell in their naturall powers and qualities, as in their ſupernatural: And that honour which is giuen to man or angel (in reſpect of any natural qualitie, may be called moral or ciuile; But that which is attributed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in regard of their ſupernatural gifts may well be called religious and ſpirituall, becauſe it is due vnto them onely for their ſpiritual and religious qualities.</p>
                     <p>There is a third kind of worſhip, yet meaner then the other; which is a kinde of dependant and reſpectiue worſhip; as when a ſeruant is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or cheeriſhed, not for his owne, but for his maiſters ſake. And this is that worſhip which wee allow vnto Images, which, for the Saints ſake whom it doeth repreſent, we doe either reuerently regard, or take off our hat, or bow our knee vnto it. This third kinde of worſhippe, being all wee allowe vnto Pictures, were he not that vnderſtands it, more than halfe franticke, that ſhould thinke it a great deſparagement vnto the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible worſhip of God, that to one of his ſeruants pictures, I ſhould yeeld ſome ſuch pettie reuerence; or that God ſhould forbid this in the fore-front of his ten Commandements? nothing leſſe.</p>
                     <p>But let vs go on with <hi>M. P.</hi> his argument: His ſecond is; the braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was an Image of Chriſt crucifyed, appoynted by God: yet when the children of Iſrael burned incence vnto it, EZECHIAS brake it in peeces<note n="*" place="margin">4. Reg. 18</note>.</p>

                     <head>ANSWERE.</head>
                     <p>So when Chriſtians generally giue godly honour to Images, as thoſe Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites did to the Serpent, let them alſo be broken by their lawful ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if no better remedie may be founde: But as that very braſen Serpent duelie worſhipped many hundreth yeares by the ſame people before they ſell to Idolatrie (as witneſſeth S. AVGVSTINE<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3. de trinit. c. 10.</note>, where hee reckoneth the brazen Serpents, among thoſe ſignes which are worthie of religious worſhip) ſo good Chriſtians, may worſhip all ſorts of holy Pictures, ſo they thinke no God to dwell in them, nor put any truſt in the Pictures, but vſe them onely to ſturre vp deuotion, to keepe their mindes from wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after their domeſticall affaires, and to conſerue the memorie of Gods happie ſeruants.</p>
                     <p>Now to the third argument, which is iollie and worthie the wilde-witte of a madde-miniſter. CHRIST would not ſo much as bow his knee vnto the deuill, although he would haue giuen him the whole world for doing of it. Therefore we muſt not odore Images, true, if the Image were M. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas</hi> enſigne, or of their maiſter the deuill, or of any of his hel-houndes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. P.</hi> His fourth reaſon: A man (ſayeth he) may be worſhipped with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21661:97"/> ciuill honour; not with religions, which is whollie preſcribed in the firſt Table, and yet the meaneſt man is a more excellent Image of God, than any paynted one.</p>

                     <p>A man may be worſhipped with religious honour, in reſpect of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural gifts, aſwell as with ciuill honour of his naturall properties, as hath bene before declared: and no other religious honor is either precribed or proſcribed in the firſt Table, then ſuch only as is proper to God.</p>

                        <note n="*" place="margin">3 Part. qu. 25. act. 3</note> holdes, that the Crucifixe is to be adored with the ſame honor that Chriſt is. Leauing THOMAS of <hi>Wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> and of <hi>Wapping</hi> to them that deſerue it: I anſwere to the place of Saint THOMAS of <hi>Aquine,</hi> that he ſpeaketh (like a moſt learned Philoſopher and diuine) very profoundly; that the Image may be conſidered in it ſelf, and ſo he ſayth, it is not to be worſhipped at all: or as it doth conuey our mind vnto that which it doth repreſent: and ſo becauſe there is but one &amp; the ſame motion of our vnderſtanding &amp; wil towards Chriſt and the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe: we do adore them both at once with the ſame act of adoration, but in a far different degree: for Chriſt we adore properly as the true God, but the crucifixe accidentally as a thing joyned with Chriſt. Euen as (ſaith he expounding himſelfe) <hi>art.</hi> 4. when one doth his homage vnto the king, he worſhippeth with all his purple garment, not that any worſhip is due to the robe, but the whole is giuen vnto the perſon, which cannot be ſeated from that which is ſo cloſely joyned to the perſon: Euen ſo the diuine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt is properly adored, but improperly al things conceiued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it; are ſaid alſo by that deep doctor to be adored, <hi>he that hath eare of hearing, let him heare:</hi> for our purpoſe it ſufficeth to know, that hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes very ſmall worſhip to themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly <hi>M P.</hi> ſayeth, without quoting any place that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> &amp; <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> in plaine tearms deny Images to be odored, and ſo do we too, taking adoring as they do for the worſhip that is proper to God.</p>

                     <p>If it were ſo, yet muſt they admit that we muſt kneele, at or before Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo we kneele to honour or pray to God: againſt which, ſome of their Preachers do cry like mad-men: but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraiſe carryeth, that wee muſt kneele to the arke, as they who be skilful in the language do know, &amp; that the arke was worſhipped of the Iſraelites is otherwiſe very euident: for firſt none, but the high Prieſt might come into the place where it was: and it was carried before the campe with great ſolemnity<note n="*" place="margin">1.

                     <p>To this may be added the authority of S. IEROM,<note n="*" place="margin">Ep 17. Cap. 3.</note> who doth teach that it was the more worſhipped for the Cherubins and pictures of angels that were erected at the ends of it: whereby he declareth that he thought Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges worthy of religious worſhippe.</p>
                     <p>To this we may joyne that of S. PAVL,<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> that IACOB by faith adored the top of his ſonne IOSEPHS rod: ſo doth the Greeke text of S. PVAL ſaye, as ERASMVS alſo tranſlateth it: The Proteſtants mangle the text pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to auoyde the place: ſee the Annot. of <hi>Rhemes</hi> Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is taken out of <hi>Exodus</hi> 3. where God ſaid to MOSES, <hi>Put off thy ſhoes for the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy.</hi> Now if places he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and to be reuerenced by reaſon of the preſence of Angels: why not, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the Image that repreſenteth an angell or ſome Saints, which is equall to Angels: <hi>M. P.</hi> his anſwere rather confirmeth than ſolueth this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for he ſayeth, that the Ceremonie of putting off his ſhoes, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſtrike MOSES with a religious reuerence; not of the place, but of the perſon there preſent, which was not God but an Angel, as the text there expreſſeth.<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> The place then being holy, required the reuerende reſpecte of putting off his ſhoes, and that reuerence done to the place; ſtroke MOSES with a religious reuerence of the Angell ſpeaking in the perſon of God: euen ſo holye pictures being firſte duely reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, doe ſtrike men with a religious regarde of the Saint repreſented. To this, let vs annexe that dayes be truely called holie and worſhipped, as the firſt and laſt daies be truely called holy and worſhipfull, as the firſt and laſt daies of the feaſt of Eaſter be.<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 12.16.</note> And the veſtments of Prieſts<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 28.5.2.</note>, becauſe they are dedicated and employed to holie vſes: euen ſo Images which are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21661:98"/> made in honour of God and his Saints, and erected to mooue and teach vs to embrace heauenly courſes.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon propoſed by <hi>M. P.</hi> in fauour of the Catholikes is: It is lawfull to kneele downe to a chaire of eſtate, in the abſence of the king: Therefore much more to the Images of God and his Saints in heauen glorifyed, being abſent from vs.</p>
                     <p>To this hee aunſwereth, that it is but a ciuill worſhip to kneele to the chaire of eſtate, and that very commendable to ſhew our loyaltie vnto our Prince: But kneeling vnto the Images of Saints, is religious, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not alike.</p>

                     <p>He propoſeth our argument to the halfes, or elſe this anſwere had bene preuented. For thus runneth our reaſon: As the chaire of eſtate is to bee worſhipped with ciuill reuerence, in reſpect of the temporall Prince, whom it repreſenteth: euen ſo the Images of holy perſonages that raigne now in heauen, are to be worſhipped with a holy and religious kinde of curteſie: for as Temporall honour is due vnto a Temporall Prince, ſo religious and ſpirituall honour, is due vnto ſpirituall and moſt holie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages: And as a good ſubject teſtifyeth his loyaltie and good affection towards his Prince, by honouring his regall throne: So doeth a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian giue teſtimonie of his dutiful, both eſtimation and deuotion toward thoſe heauenly creatures, by giuing honor vnto their Images. At leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why do not the Proteſtants exhibit ciuill reuerence aſwel vnto the repreſentations of Gods Saints, as to the ſhaddowes of the ſecular maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie? vnleſſe it be becauſe they are fallen out with the Saints of God, and are become adorers of ſinfull men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>M. P.</hi> makes a third poynt of difference, that we may not worſhip God in any ſuch Image, in which he hath appeared vnto men. In this we do not differ, vnleſſe he takes it otherwiſe then he deliuereth it. Thoſe Images we hold more reuerend than any others, as repreſentations neerer approching vnto the diuinitie, yet becauſe they do not expreſſe the deitie, God is not directly apprehended nor worſhipped in them, but onely by collection, as for example. The forme of a graue old man, in DANIEL, doth not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Gods perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but we gather by that ancient forme Gods eternity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ariſe to a meere perfect conceit of God, whom we adore: now other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of Chriſt &amp; his Saints, do carry our minds directly vpon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſons, whome in their Images wee adore and worſhippe vnto their degrees. But wee worſhippe Images with farre meaner reuerence than any of the Saints, in regard onely, that they do repreſent ſuch perſonages,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21661:98"/> and do induce vs more to loue and honour them, and do ſtur vp our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more often and ardently to honour God in the Saints, and the Saints in their degrees: as alſo to imitate their holy example as hath bin ſaid more than once, that all may vnderſtand how far off we are from giuing Gods honor vnto either Saint or Image. But this poynt of difference is made to bring in a common argument of theirs, to wit, that the worſhipping of the golden Calfe is condemned as flat Idolatrie:<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 32</note> &amp; yet the Iſraelits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped not the Calfe but God: The Calfe, to which we ſay, they did not worſhip the true God; the Calfe, but the god of the Egiptians, which was taken by them to haue the ſhape of a blacke Calfe, with white ſpots.<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 18. de ciuit. c. 5</note> See S. AVGST.<note n="*" place="margin">1. De nat deor.</note> And therfore making the golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> calfe to repreſent this falſe god, &amp; attributing their deliuerance, vnto that ſuppoſed god, &amp; not vnto the God of Iſrael, committed idolatrie, which the text prooueth moſt manifeſt, <hi>theſe be thy gods that brought thee out of Egipt.</hi> M. P. anſwereth,<note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is nothing elſe, but that the golden Calfe was a ſigne of the preſence of the true God: ſuch gloſſes without any authority of the auncient fathers is ridiculous, being againſt the plaine text: but ſayeth he, wee muſt not thinke them ſo madde, as to take a Calfe made with their eare-rings to be their God, no: but we may well thinke them ſo vngratefull vnto the true God their deliuerer, that they did aſcribe their deliuerance not to him, but vnto that God, which the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> ſerued, whoſe purtraiture was that Calfe.</p>
                     <p>But now before we end this queſtion, I muſt let you vnderſtand what worthy men they were that firſt began to wage battel againſt images: they were the Iewes in their <hi>Talmud.
